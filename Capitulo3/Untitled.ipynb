      "to spend the night with him.  And in the first place, you will be so\n",
      "good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I\n",

      "me--but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who\n",
      "stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged\n",
      "in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.\"\n",

      "little Johnny in the foot of it.  But I got a dreaming and sprawling\n",
      "about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came\n",
      "near breaking his arm.  Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do.  Come\n",
      "along here, I'll give ye a glim in a jiffy;\" and so saying he lighted\n",
      "a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.  But I\n",
      "stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed\n",
      "\"I vum it's Sunday--you won't see that harpooneer to-night; he's come\n",
      "to anchor somewhere--come along then; DO come; WON'T ye come?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I\n",
      "was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure\n",
      "enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four\n",
      "harpooneers to sleep abreast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There,\" said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea\n",
      "chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; \"there,\n",
      "make yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.\"  I turned\n",
      "round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed.  Though none of\n",
      "the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well.  I then\n",
      "glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,\n",
      "could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude\n",
      "shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man\n",
      "striking a whale.  Of things not properly belonging to the room,\n",
      "there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one\n",
      "corner; also a large seaman's bag, containing the harpooneer's\n",
      "wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.  Likewise, there was a\n",
      "parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the\n",
      "fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what is this on the chest?  I took it up, and held it close to\n",
      "the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to\n",
      "arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it.  I can compare\n",
      "it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with\n",
      "little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills\n",
      "round an Indian moccasin.  There was a hole or slit in the middle of\n",
      "this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos.  But could\n",
      "it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat,\n",
      "and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise?\n",
      "I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being\n",
      "uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though\n",
      "this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day.  I\n",
      "went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never\n",
      "saw such a sight in my life.  I tore myself out of it in such a hurry\n",
      "that I gave myself a kink in the neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\n",
      "head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat.  After thinking some time\n",
      "on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then\n",
      "stood in the middle of the room thinking.  I then took off my coat,\n",
      "and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.  But beginning to feel\n",
      "very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the\n",
      "landlord said about the harpooneer's not coming home at all that\n",
      "night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of\n",
      "my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into\n",
      "bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\n",
      "there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not\n",
      "sleep for a long time.  At last I slid off into a light doze, and had\n",
      "pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I\n",
      "heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light\n",
      "come into the room from under the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\n",
      "head-peddler.  But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a\n",
      "word till spoken to.  Holding a light in one hand, and that identical\n",
      "New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and\n",
      "without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off\n",
      "from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at\n",
      "the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the\n",
      "room.  I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted\n",
      "for some time while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth.  This\n",
      "accomplished, however, he turned round--when, good heavens! what a\n",
      "sight!  Such a face!  It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here\n",
      "and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares.  Yes, it's\n",
      "just as I thought, he's a terrible bedfellow; he's been in a fight,\n",
      "got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon.  But at\n",
      "that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I\n",
      "plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black\n",
      "squares on his cheeks.  They were stains of some sort or other.  At\n",
      "first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the\n",
      "truth occurred to me.  I remembered a story of a white man--a\n",
      "whaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by\n",
      "them.  I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant\n",
      "voyages, must have met with a similar adventure.  And what is it,\n",
      "thought I, after all!  It's only his outside; a man can be honest in\n",
      "any sort of skin.  But then, what to make of his unearthly\n",
      "complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and\n",
      "completely independent of the squares of tattooing.  To be sure, it\n",
      "might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never\n",
      "heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one.\n",
      "However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun\n",
      "there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.  Now, while\n",
      "all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this\n",
      "harpooneer never noticed me at all.  But, after some difficulty\n",
      "having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently\n",
      "pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair\n",
      "on.  Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he\n",
      "then took the New Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed\n",
      "it down into the bag.  He now took off his hat--a new beaver\n",
      "hat--when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.  There was no\n",
      "hair on his head--none to speak of at least--nothing but a small\n",
      "scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead.  His bald purplish head now\n",
      "looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.  Had not the stranger\n",
      "stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker\n",
      "than ever I bolted a dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window,\n",
      "but it was the second floor back.  I am no coward, but what to make\n",
      "of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my\n",
      "comprehension.  Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely\n",
      "nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as\n",
      "much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken\n",
      "into my room at the dead of night.  In fact, I was so afraid of him\n",
      "that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a\n",
      "satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last\n",
      "showed his chest and arms.  As I live, these covered parts of him\n",
      "were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was\n",
      "all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty\n",
      "Years' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt.\n",
      "Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green\n",
      "frogs were running up the trunks of young palms.  It was now quite\n",
      "plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard\n",

      "But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\n",
      "something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me\n",
      "that he must indeed be a heathen.  Going to his heavy grego, or\n",
      "wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he\n",
      "fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little\n",
      "deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a\n",
      "three days' old Congo baby.  Remembering the embalmed head, at first\n",
      "I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved\n",
      "in some similar manner.  But seeing that it was not at all limber,\n",
      "and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded\n",
      "that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to\n",
      "be.  For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing\n",
      "the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like\n",
      "a tenpin, between the andirons.  The chimney jambs and all the bricks\n",
      "inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very\n",
      "appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\n",
      "ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow.  First he takes\n",
      "about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and\n",
      "places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship\n",
      "biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the\n",
      "shavings into a sacrificial blaze.  Presently, after many hasty\n",
      "snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers\n",
      "(whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded\n",
      "in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a\n",
      "little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro.  But the\n",
      "little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he\n",
      "never moved his lips.  All these strange antics were accompanied by\n",
      "still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be\n",
      "praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other,\n",
      "during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.\n",
      "At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very\n",
      "unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as\n",
      "carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and\n",
      "seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\n",
      "operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\n",
      "now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in\n",
      "which I had so long been bound.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal\n",
      "one.  Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of\n",
      "it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth\n",
      "at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke.  The next\n",
      "moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk\n",
      "between his teeth, sprang into bed with me.  I sang out, I could not\n",
      "help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began\n",
      "feeling me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\n",
      "against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\n",
      "be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.  But\n",
      "his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill\n",
      "comprehended my meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who-e debel you?\"--he at last said--\"you no speak-e, dam-me, I\n",

      "the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on\n",
      "fire.  But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the\n",
      "room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be afraid now,\" said he, grinning again, \"Queequeg here\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Stop your grinning,\" shouted I, \"and why didn't you tell me that\n",

      "sitting up in bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You gettee in,\" he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and\n",
      "throwing the clothes to one side.  He really did this in not only a\n",
      "civil but a really kind and charitable way.  I stood looking at him a\n",
      "moment.  For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely\n",
      "looking cannibal.  What's all this fuss I have been making about,\n",
      "thought I to myself--the man's a human being just as I am: he has\n",
      "just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him.\n",
      "Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord,\" said I, \"tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe,\n",
      "or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I\n",
      "will turn in with him.  But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed\n",
      "with me.  It's dangerous.  Besides, I ain't insured.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely\n",

      "Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm\n",
      "thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner.  You had\n",
      "almost thought I had been his wife.  The counterpane was of\n",
      "patchwork, full of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles;\n",
      "and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan\n",
      "labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise\n",
      "shade--owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically\n",
      "in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various\n",
      "times--this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a\n",
      "strip of that same patchwork quilt.  Indeed, partly lying on it as\n",
      "the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the\n",
      "quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the\n",
      "sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was\n",
      "hugging me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sensations were strange.  Let me try to explain them.  When I was\n",
      "a child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell\n",
      "me; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely\n",
      "settle.  The circumstance was this.  I had been cutting up some caper\n",
      "or other--I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had\n",
      "seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who,\n",
      "somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed\n",
      "supperless,--my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and\n",
      "packed me off to bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon\n",
      "of the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere.  I\n",
      "felt dreadfully.  But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went\n",
      "to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as\n",
      "possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the\n",
      "sheets.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must\n",
      "elapse before I could hope for a resurrection.  Sixteen hours in bed!\n",
      "the small of my back ached to think of it.  And it was so light too;\n",
      "the sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in\n",
      "the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house.  I felt\n",
      "worse and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in\n",
      "my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw\n",
      "myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a\n",
      "good slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning\n",
      "me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time.  But she was the\n",
      "best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to\n",
      "my room.  For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great\n",
      "deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest\n",
      "subsequent misfortunes.  At last I must have fallen into a troubled\n",
      "nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it--half steeped in\n",
      "dreams--I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped\n",
      "in outer darkness.  Instantly I felt a shock running through all my\n",
      "frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a\n",
      "supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.  My arm hung over the\n",
      "counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom,\n",
      "to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side.\n",
      "For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most\n",
      "awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that\n",
      "if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be\n",
      "broken.  I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from\n",
      "me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and\n",
      "for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding\n",
      "attempts to explain the mystery.  Nay, to this very hour, I often\n",
      "puzzle myself with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\n",
      "supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness,\n",
      "to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan\n",
      "arm thrown round me.  But at length all the past night's events\n",
      "soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only\n",
      "alive to the comical predicament.  For though I tried to move his\n",
      "arm--unlock his bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still\n",
      "hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain.\n",
      "I now strove to rouse him--\"Queequeg!\"--but his only answer was a\n",
      "snore.  I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a\n",
      "horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch.  Throwing aside the\n",
      "counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage's side, as\n",
      "if it were a hatchet-faced baby.  A pretty pickle, truly, thought I;\n",
      "abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a\n",
      "tomahawk!  \"Queequeg!--in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!\"  At\n",
      "length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant\n",
      "expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male\n",
      "in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt;\n",
      "and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a\n",
      "Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a\n",
      "pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not\n",
      "altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\n",
      "consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning\n",
      "over him.  Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious\n",
      "misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a\n",
      "creature.  When, at last, his mind seemed made up touching the\n",
      "character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to\n",
      "the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and\n",
      "sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress\n",
      "first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole\n",
      "apartment to myself.  Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances,\n",
      "this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages\n",
      "have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous\n",
      "how essentially polite they are.  I pay this particular compliment to\n",
      "Queequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and\n",
      "consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him\n",
      "from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my\n",
      "curiosity getting the better of my breeding.  Nevertheless, a man\n",
      "like Queequeg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well\n",
      "worth unusual regarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall\n",
      "one, by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--he hunted up his\n",
      "boots.  What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his\n",
      "next movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under\n",
      "the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I\n",
      "inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of\n",
      "propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private\n",
      "when putting on his boots.  But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature\n",
      "in the transition stage--neither caterpillar nor butterfly.  He was\n",
      "just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest\n",
      "possible manners.  His education was not yet completed.  He was an\n",
      "undergraduate.  If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very\n",
      "probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then,\n",
      "if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of\n",
      "getting under the bed to put them on.  At last, he emerged with his\n",
      "hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began\n",
      "creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed\n",
      "to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones--probably not made\n",
      "to order either--rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off\n",
      "of a bitter cold morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\n",
      "street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view\n",
      "into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that\n",
      "Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots\n",
      "on; I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet\n",
      "somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as\n",
      "possible.  He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself.  At that\n",
      "time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but\n",
      "Queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his\n",
      "ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands.  He then donned his\n",
      "waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand\n",
      "centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face.\n",
      "I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he\n",
      "takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden\n",
      "stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and\n",
      "striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous\n",
      "scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.  Thinks I, Queequeg,\n",
      "this is using Rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance.  Afterwards I\n",
      "wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine\n",
      "steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the\n",
      "long straight edges are always kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out\n",
      "of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and\n",

      "utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical\n",
      "peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life\n",
      "he had led.  When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,\n",
      "and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran\n",
      "down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed\n",
      "almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had\n",
      "absorbed.  However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one\n",
      "removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when,\n",
      "arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\n",
      "regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the\n",
      "floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the\n",
      "architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and\n",
      "finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular\n",
      "side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.\n",
      "The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome\n",

      "nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole\n",
      "contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no\n",
      "means in bad taste.  Halting for an instant at the foot of the\n",
      "ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the\n",
      "man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly\n",
      "sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted\n",
      "the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case\n",

      "glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient\n",
      "for a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary.\n",
      "For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height,\n",
      "slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up\n",
      "the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving\n",
      "him impregnable in his little Quebec.\n",

      "I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\n",

      "sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any\n",
      "mere tricks of the stage.  No, thought I, there must be some sober\n",
      "reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something\n",

      "\n",
      "But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\n",
      "borrowed from the chaplain's former sea-farings.  Between the marble\n",
      "cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its\n",
      "back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship\n",
      "beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and\n",
      "snowy breakers.  But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling\n",
      "clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed\n",
      "forth an angel's face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of\n",
      "radiance upon the ship's tossed deck, something like that silver\n",

      "back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant\n",
      "seemed on the point of snapping into splinters.  Nothing was done,\n",
      "and nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed\n",
      "towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower\n",
      "jaw of an exasperated whale.  In the midst of this consternation,\n",
      "Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the path of\n",
      "the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks,\n",

      "it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way\n",
      "trapped, and all was safe.  The schooner was run into the wind, and\n",
      "while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped\n",
      "to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap.\n",
      "For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing\n",
      "his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his\n",
      "brawny shoulders through the freezing foam.  I looked at the grand\n",
      "and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.  The greenhorn had\n",
      "gone down.  Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water,\n",
      "Queequeg, now took an instant's glance around him, and seeming to see\n",
      "just how matters were, dived down and disappeared.  A few minutes\n",
      "more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the\n",
      "other dragging a lifeless form.  The boat soon picked them up.  The\n",
      "poor bumpkin was restored.  All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump;\n",

      "darkened like a French grenadier's, who has alike fought in Egypt and\n",
      "Siberia.  Her venerable bows looked bearded.  Her masts--cut\n",
      "somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost\n",
      "overboard in a gale--her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of\n",
      "the three old kings of Cologne.  Her ancient decks were worn and\n",

      "eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till\n",
      "you could clutch something--a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to\n",

      "idleness perished before him.  His own person was the exact\n",
      "embodiment of his utilitarian character.  On his long, gaunt body, he\n",
      "carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft,\n",

      "decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always\n",
      "sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails.  His\n",
      "broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his\n",
      "drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he\n",
      "seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.\n",
      "\n",

      "that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very\n",

      "receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had\n",
      "heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony\n",
      "Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod,\n",
      "therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners,\n",
      "left nearly the whole management of the ship's affairs to these two.\n",
      "And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty\n",

      "board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his\n",

      "to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small\n",
      "surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these\n",
      "proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself\n",
      "out of his book, \"LAY not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, Captain Bildad,\" interrupted Peleg, \"what d'ye say, what lay\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Thou knowest best,\" was the sepulchral reply, \"the seven hundred and\n",

      "\n",
      "LAY, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\n",
      "seventy-seventh!  Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for\n",
      "one, shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do\n",
      "corrupt.  It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though\n",
      "from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a\n",
      "landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven\n",
      "hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you\n",
      "come to make a TEENTH of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven\n",
      "hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less\n",

      "at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,\" cried Peleg, \"thou dost not want to\n",
      "swindle this young man! he must have more than that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,\" again said Bildad, without\n",
      "lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling--\"for where your treasure\n",
      "is, there will your heart be also.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,\" said Peleg, \"do\n",

      "\n",
      "Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\n",

      "orphans, many of them--and that if we too abundantly reward the\n",

      "Captain Peleg.\"\n",

      "all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\n",
      "commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad,\n",
      "who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the\n",
      "awakened wrath of Peleg.  But to my astonishment, he sat down again\n",
      "on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest\n",
      "intention of withdrawing.  He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg\n",
      "and his ways.  As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had,\n",
      "there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb,\n",
      "though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated.  \"Whew!\"\n",
      "he whistled at last--\"the squall's gone off to leeward, I think.\n",
      "Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen,\n",
      "will ye.  My jack-knife here needs the grindstone.  That's he; thank\n",
      "ye, Bildad.  Now then, my young man, Ishmael's thy name, didn't ye\n",
      "say?  Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth\n",
      "lay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg,\" said I, \"I have a friend with me who wants to ship\n",
      "too--shall I bring him down to-morrow?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure,\" said Peleg.  \"Fetch him along, and we'll look at him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What lay does he want?\" groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book\n",
      "in which he had again been burying himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,\" said Peleg.  \"Has he ever\n",

      "And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that\n",
      "I had done a good morning's work, and that the Pequod was the\n",
      "identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round\n",
      "the Cape.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the\n",
      "Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,\n",
      "indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out,\n",
      "and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself\n",
      "visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are\n",
      "so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief,\n",
      "that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of\n",
      "that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port,\n",
      "but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea.  However, it\n",
      "is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing\n",
      "yourself into his hands.  Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg,\n",
      "inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab?  It's all right enough;\n",
      "thou art shipped.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but I should like to see him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present.  I don't know\n",
      "exactly what's the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the\n",
      "house; a sort of sick, and yet he don't look so.  In fact, he ain't\n",
      "sick; but no, he isn't well either.  Any how, young man, he won't\n",
      "always see me, so I don't suppose he will thee.  He's a queer man,\n",
      "Captain Ahab--so some think--but a good one.  Oh, thou'lt like him\n",
      "well enough; no fear, no fear.  He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man,\n",
      "Captain Ahab; doesn't speak much; but, when he does speak, then you\n",
      "may well listen.  Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab's above the common;\n",
      "Ahab's been in colleges, as well as 'mong the cannibals; been used to\n",
      "deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier,\n",
      "stranger foes than whales.  His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest\n",
      "that out of all our isle!  Oh! he ain't Captain Bildad; no, and he\n",
      "ain't Captain Peleg; HE'S AHAB, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest,\n",
      "was a crowned king!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And a very vile one.  When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did\n",
      "they not lick his blood?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come hither to me--hither, hither,\" said Peleg, with a significance\n",
      "in his eye that almost startled me.  \"Look ye, lad; never say that on\n",
      "board the Pequod.  Never say it anywhere.  Captain Ahab did not name\n",
      "himself.  'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed\n",
      "mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old.  And yet the old\n",
      "squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove\n",
      "prophetic.  And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the\n",
      "same.  I wish to warn thee.  It's a lie.  I know Captain Ahab well;\n",
      "I've sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is--a good\n",
      "man--not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good\n",
      "man--something like me--only there's a good deal more of him.  Aye,\n",
      "aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the\n",
      "passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was\n",
      "the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that\n",
      "about, as any one might see.  I know, too, that ever since he lost\n",
      "his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he's been a kind of\n",
      "moody--desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass\n",
      "off.  And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man,\n",
      "it's better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad\n",
      "one.  So good-bye to thee--and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he\n",
      "happens to have a wicked name.  Besides, my boy, he has a wife--not\n",
      "three voyages wedded--a sweet, resigned girl.  Think of that; by that\n",

      "time, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't know\n",
      "what, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg.  And yet I also felt a\n",
      "strange awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all\n",

      "the rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to\n",

      "\"No more, Queequeg,\" said I, shuddering; \"that will do;\" for I knew\n",

      "who had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the\n",
      "custom, when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all\n",
      "the slain in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one,\n",
      "they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like\n",
      "a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in\n",
      "their mouths, were sent round with the victor's compliments to all\n",

      "\n",
      "After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\n",

      "seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered\n",
      "from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more\n",
      "than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,\n",
      "finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true\n",
      "religion than I did.  He looked at me with a sort of condescending\n",

      "The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and\n",
      "a Quaker by descent.  He was a long, earnest man, and though born on\n",
      "an icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh\n",
      "being hard as twice-baked biscuit.  Transported to the Indies, his\n",
      "live blood would not spoil like bottled ale.  He must have been born\n",
      "in some time of general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast\n",
      "days for which his state is famous.  Only some thirty arid summers\n",
      "had he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical\n",
      "superfluousness.  But this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more\n",
      "the token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed the\n",
      "indication of any bodily blight.  It was merely the condensation of\n",
      "the man.  He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary.  His\n",
      "pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it,\n",
      "and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a revivified\n",
      "Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to\n",
      "come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid\n",
      "sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted\n",
      "to do well in all climates.  Looking into his eyes, you seemed to\n",
      "see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he\n",
      "had calmly confronted through life.  A staid, steadfast man, whose\n",
      "life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a\n",
      "tame chapter of sounds.  Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and\n",
      "fortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times\n",
      "affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the\n",
      "rest.  Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep\n",
      "natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did\n",
      "therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort of\n",
      "superstition, which in some organizations seems rather to spring,\n",
      "somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance.  Outward portents and\n",
      "inward presentiments were his.  And if at times these things bent the\n",
      "welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories\n",
      "of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from\n",
      "the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to\n",
      "those latent influences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain\n",
      "the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more\n",
      "perilous vicissitudes of the fishery.  \"I will have no man in my\n",
      "boat,\" said Starbuck, \"who is not afraid of a whale.\"  By this, he\n",
      "seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage\n",
      "was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered\n",
      "peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous\n",
      "comrade than a coward.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye,\" said Stubb, the second mate, \"Starbuck, there, is as\n",
      "careful a man as you'll find anywhere in this fishery.\"  But we shall\n",

      "man like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a\n",
      "sentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon\n",
      "all mortally practical occasions.  Besides, he thought, perhaps, that\n",
      "in this business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple\n",
      "outfits of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be\n",
      "foolishly wasted.  Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales\n",
      "after sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much\n",
      "persisted in fighting him.  For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this\n",
      "critical ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by\n",
      "them for theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck\n",
      "well knew.  What doom was his own father's?  Where, in the bottomless\n",
      "deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?\n",
      "\n",
      "With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain\n",
      "superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck\n",
      "which could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been\n",
      "extreme.  But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so\n",
      "organized, and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he\n",
      "had; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently\n",
      "engendering an element in him, which, under suitable circumstances,\n",
      "would break out from its confinement, and burn all his courage up.\n",
      "And brave as he might be, it was that sort of bravery chiefly,\n",
      "visible in some intrepid men, which, while generally abiding firm in\n",
      "the conflict with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the ordinary\n",
      "irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand those more\n",
      "terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you\n",
      "from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man.\n",
      "\n",
      "But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete\n",
      "abasement of poor Starbuck's fortitude, scarce might I have the heart\n",
      "to write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to\n",
      "expose the fall of valour in the soul.  Men may seem detestable as\n",
      "joint stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there\n",
      "may be; men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal,\n",
      "is so noble and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that\n",
      "over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to\n",
      "throw their costliest robes.  That immaculate manliness we feel\n",
      "within ourselves, so far within us, that it remains intact though all\n",
      "the outer character seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the\n",
      "undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined man.  Nor can piety itself, at\n",
      "such a shameful sight, completely stifle her upbraidings against the\n",
      "permitting stars.  But this august dignity I treat of, is not the\n",
      "dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity which has no\n",
      "robed investiture.  Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields\n",
      "a pick or drives a spike; that democratic dignity which, on all\n",

      "happy-go-lucky; neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they\n",

      "about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat, as an\n",
      "old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box.  When close to the\n",
      "whale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying\n",

      "itself, there is no telling.  Whether he ever thought of it at all,\n",
      "might be a question; but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that\n",
      "way after a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took\n",
      "it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir\n",

      "unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a\n",
      "world full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their\n",
      "packs; what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of\n",
      "his; that thing must have been his pipe.  For, like his nose, his\n",
      "short, black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face.\n",
      "You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk\n",
      "without his nose as without his pipe.  He kept a whole row of pipes\n",
      "there ready loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand;\n",
      "and, whenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in succession,\n",
      "lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter; then loading\n",
      "them again to be in readiness anew.  For, when Stubb dressed, instead\n",

      "I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of\n",

      "personally and hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a\n",
      "sort of point of honour with him, to destroy them whenever\n",
      "encountered.  So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for\n",
      "the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways; and so dead\n",
      "to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from\n",
      "encountering them; that in his poor opinion, the wondrous whale was\n",
      "but a species of magnified mouse, or at least water-rat, requiring\n",
      "only a little circumvention and some small application of time and\n",
      "trouble in order to kill and boil.  This ignorant, unconscious\n",
      "fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of\n",
      "whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years'\n",
      "voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length\n",
      "of time.  As a carpenter's nails are divided into wrought nails and\n",
      "cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided.  Little Flask was one\n",
      "of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long.  They called\n",
      "him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could be\n",
      "well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in Arctic\n",
      "whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers\n",
      "inserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy\n",
      "concussions of those battering seas.\n",

      "Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the\n",
      "whales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies.  Or,\n",
      "being armed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a\n",

      "And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a\n",

      "harpooneer, who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh\n",
      "lance, when the former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the\n",
      "assault; and moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a\n",
      "close intimacy and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in\n",
      "this place we set down who the Pequod's harpooneers were, and to what\n",
      "headsman each of them belonged.\n",
      "\n",

      "remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the\n",
      "neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring\n",
      "harpooneers.  In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of\n",
      "Gay-Headers.  Tashtego's long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek\n",
      "bones, and black rounding eyes--for an Indian, Oriental in their\n",
      "largeness, but Antarctic in their glittering expression--all this\n",
      "sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of\n",
      "those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England\n",
      "moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main.\n",
      "But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the\n",
      "woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the\n",
      "sea; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible\n",
      "arrow of the sires.  To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky\n",
      "limbs, you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of\n",
      "the earlier Puritans, and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son\n",
      "of the Prince of the Powers of the Air.  Tashtego was Stubb the\n",
      "second mate's squire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black\n",
      "negro-savage, with a lion-like tread--an Ahasuerus to behold.\n",
      "Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the\n",
      "sailors called them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the\n",
      "top-sail halyards to them.  In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily\n",
      "shipped on board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native\n",
      "coast.  And never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa,\n",
      "Nantucket, and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen; and\n",
      "having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the\n",
      "ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they\n",
      "shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a\n",
      "giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in\n",
      "his socks.  There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and\n",
      "a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce\n",
      "of a fortress.  Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus\n",
      "Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man\n",
      "beside him.  As for the residue of the Pequod's company, be it said,\n",
      "that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men\n",
      "before the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans\n",
      "born, though pretty nearly all the officers are.  Herein it is the\n",

      "military and merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in\n",
      "the construction of the American Canals and Railroads.  The same, I\n",
      "say, because in all these cases the native American liberally\n",
      "provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying\n",
      "the muscles.  No small number of these whaling seamen belong to the\n",

      "\n",
      "There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the\n",

      "when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without\n",
      "consuming them, or taking away one particle from their compacted aged\n",
      "robustness.  His whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze,\n",
      "and shaped in an unalterable mould, like Cellini's cast Perseus.\n",
      "Threading its way out from among his grey hairs, and continuing right\n",
      "down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it\n",
      "disappeared in his clothing, you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly\n",
      "whitish.  It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the\n",
      "straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the upper lightning\n",
      "tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig, peels\n",
      "and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off into the\n",
      "soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded.  Whether\n",
      "that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some\n",
      "desperate wound, no one could certainly say.  By some tacit consent,\n",
      "throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it,\n",
      "especially by the mates.  But once Tashtego's senior, an old Gay-Head\n",
      "Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was\n",
      "full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and then it\n",
      "came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an\n",
      "elemental strife at sea.  Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially\n",
      "negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man,\n",
      "who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this\n",
      "laid eye upon wild Ahab.  Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the\n",
      "immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old Manxman with\n",

      "to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood.  It had\n",
      "previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned\n",
      "from the polished bone of the sperm whale's jaw.  \"Aye, he was\n",

      "I was struck with the singular posture he maintained.  Upon each side\n",
      "of the Pequod's quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,\n",
      "there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the\n",
      "plank.  His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and\n",
      "holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out\n",
      "beyond the ship's ever-pitching prow.  There was an infinity of\n",
      "firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the\n",
      "fixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance.  Not a word he\n",
      "spoke; nor did his officers say aught to him; though by all their\n",
      "minutest gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if\n",
      "not painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye.  And\n",
      "not only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a\n",
      "crucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing\n",
      "dignity of some mighty woe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his\n",
      "cabin.  But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew;\n",
      "either standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he\n",
      "had; or heavily walking the deck.  As the sky grew less gloomy;\n",
      "indeed, began to grow a little genial, he became still less and less\n",
      "a recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the\n",
      "dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded.  And,\n",
      "by and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in the\n",
      "air; but, as yet, for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at\n",
      "last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast.  But\n",

      "Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the\n",

      "with whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will\n",
      "try.  There are some preliminaries to settle.\n",
      "\n",
      "First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology\n",
      "is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters\n",
      "it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish.  In his\n",
      "System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, \"I hereby separate\n",
      "the whales from the fish.\"  But of my own knowledge, I know that down\n",
      "to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against\n",
      "Linnaeus's express edict, were still found dividing the possession of\n",
      "the same seas with the Leviathan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales\n",
      "from the waters, he states as follows: \"On account of their warm\n",
      "bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow\n",
      "ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,\" and finally, \"ex\n",
      "lege naturae jure meritoque.\"  I submitted all this to my friends\n",
      "Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine\n",
      "in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons\n",
      "set forth were altogether insufficient.  Charley profanely hinted\n",
      "they were humbug.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\n",
      "ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.\n",
      "This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal\n",
      "respect does the whale differ from other fish.  Above, Linnaeus has\n",
      "given you those items.  But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm\n",
      "blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\n",
      "conspicuously to label him for all time to come?  To be short, then,\n",
      "a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL.  There you have\n",
      "him.  However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded\n",
      "meditation.  A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not\n",
      "a fish, because he is amphibious.  But the last term of the\n",
      "definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first.  Almost\n",
      "any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have\n",
      "not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail.  Whereas, among\n",
      "spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably\n",
      "assumes a horizontal position.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude\n",
      "from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified\n",
      "with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other\n",
      "hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as\n",
      "alien.*  Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish\n",
      "must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology.  Now, then, come\n",
      "the grand divisions of the entire whale host.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins\n",
      "and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are\n",
      "included by many naturalists among the whales.  But as these pig-fish\n",
      "are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of\n",
      "rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout,\n",

      "Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the\n",
      "whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing\n",
      "the Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks.  In the length he\n",
      "attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale,\n",
      "but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to\n",
      "olive.  His great lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the\n",
      "intertwisting, slanting folds of large wrinkles.  His grand\n",
      "distinguishing feature, the fin, from which he derives his name, is\n",
      "often a conspicuous object.  This fin is some three or four feet\n",
      "long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an\n",
      "angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end.  Even if not the\n",
      "slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin\n",
      "will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface.  When\n",
      "the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical\n",
      "ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon\n",
      "the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle\n",
      "surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy\n",
      "hour-lines graved on it.  On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes\n",
      "back.  The Fin-Back is not gregarious.  He seems a whale-hater, as\n",
      "some men are man-haters.  Very shy; always going solitary;\n",
      "unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen\n",
      "waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall\n",
      "misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous\n",
      "power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from\n",
      "man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his\n",
      "race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back.  From having the\n",
      "baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the\n",
      "right whale, among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES,\n",
      "that is, whales with baleen.  Of these so called Whalebone whales,\n",
      "there would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are\n",
      "little known.  Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed\n",
      "whales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales, are\n",

      "great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be\n",
      "convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it\n",
      "is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan,\n",
      "founded upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth;\n",
      "notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously\n",
      "seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of\n",
      "Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the\n",
      "whale, in his kinds, presents.  How then?  The baleen, hump,\n",
      "back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are\n",
      "indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any\n",
      "regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and\n",
      "more essential particulars.  Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked\n",
      "whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.  Then, this\n",
      "same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has\n",
      "baleen; but there again the similitude ceases.  And it is just the\n",
      "same with the other parts above mentioned.  In various sorts of\n",
      "whales, they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any\n",
      "one of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy\n",
      "all general methodization formed upon such a basis.  On this rock\n",
      "every one of the whale-naturalists has split.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the\n",

      "right classification.  Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the\n",
      "Greenland whale's anatomy more striking than his baleen?  Yet we have\n",
      "seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the\n",

      "leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part\n",

      "\n",
      "The large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced\n",
      "by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\n",
      "and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in\n",
      "the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\n",
      "officer called the Specksynder.  Literally this word means\n",

      "Harpooneer.  In those days, the captain's authority was restricted to\n",
      "the navigation and general management of the vessel; while over the\n",
      "whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the Specksynder or\n",
      "Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme.  In the British Greenland Fishery,\n",
      "under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is\n",
      "still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged.  At present\n",
      "he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the\n",
      "captain's more inferior subalterns.  Nevertheless, as upon the good\n",
      "conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely\n",
      "depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an\n",
      "important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night\n",
      "watches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship's deck is also\n",
      "his; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he\n",

      "by them, familiarly regarded as their social equal.\n",

      "King of Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but\n",

      "observation, even upon so neutral a topic as the weather.  No!  And\n",
      "when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef\n",
      "was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the\n",
      "mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly;\n",
      "and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the\n",
      "plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without\n",

      "the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial\n",
      "Electors, so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in\n",
      "awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation;\n",
      "only he himself was dumb.  What a relief it was to choking Stubb,\n",
      "when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below.  And poor little\n",
      "Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary family\n",
      "party.  His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have\n",
      "been the drumsticks.  For Flask to have presumed to help himself,\n",
      "this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first\n",
      "degree.  Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more\n",
      "would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;\n",
      "nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him.  And had Flask\n",
      "helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed\n",

      "Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on\n",
      "account of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he\n",

      "If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have\n",
      "but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his\n",

      "three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to\n",
      "precede Flask to the deck.  Therefore it was that Flask once admitted\n",
      "in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an\n",
      "officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be\n",
      "otherwise than hungry, more or less.  For what he ate did not so much\n",

      "seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the\n",

      "once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy's memory\n",
      "by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty\n",
      "wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the\n",

      "standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical\n",
      "tumultuous visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy's whole life\n",
      "was one continual lip-quiver.  Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers\n",
      "furnished with all things they demanded, he would escape from their\n",
      "clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at\n",

      "the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to\n",
      "the low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the\n",
      "low cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes\n",
      "passenger in a ship.  But for all this, the great negro was\n",
      "wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty.  It seemed hardly possible\n",
      "that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the\n",
      "vitality diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a person.\n",
      "But, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the\n",
      "abounding element of air; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in\n",
      "the sublime life of the worlds.  Not by beef or by bread, are giants\n",
      "made or nourished.  But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of\n",
      "the lip in eating--an ugly sound enough--so much so, that the\n",
      "trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth\n",
      "lurked in his own lean arms.  And when he would hear Tashtego singing\n",
      "out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be picked, the\n",
      "simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round\n",
      "him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy.  Nor did the\n",
      "whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their\n",
      "lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they\n",
      "would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not\n",

      "guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions.  Alas!  Dough-Boy!\n",
      "hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals.  Not a napkin\n",
      "should he carry on his arm, but a buckler.  In good time, though, to\n",

      "permanent thing, residing in the open air.  Nor did they lose much\n",

      "It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with\n",
      "the other seamen my first mast-head came round.\n",
      "\n",
      "In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost\n",
      "simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port; even though she\n",
      "may have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her\n",
      "proper cruising ground.  And if, after a three, four, or five years'\n",
      "voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her--say, an\n",
      "empty vial even--then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last;\n",
      "and not till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port,\n",
      "does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a\n",
      "very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate\n",
      "here.  I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the\n",
      "old Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to\n",
      "them.  For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must\n",
      "doubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest\n",
      "mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was\n",
      "put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have\n",
      "gone by the board, in the dread gale of God's wrath; therefore, we\n",
      "cannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians.  And\n",
      "that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is an\n",
      "assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists, that\n",
      "the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory\n",
      "singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four\n",
      "sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of\n",
      "their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and\n",
      "sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing\n",
      "out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight.  In Saint Stylites,\n",
      "the famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone\n",
      "pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life\n",
      "on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle; in\n",
      "him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless\n",
      "stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by\n",
      "fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything\n",
      "out to the last, literally died at his post.  Of modern\n",
      "standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,\n",
      "and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,\n",
      "are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon\n",
      "discovering any strange sight.  There is Napoleon; who, upon the top\n",
      "of the column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred\n",
      "and fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;\n",
      "whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil.  Great\n",
      "Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in\n",
      "Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars, his column marks that\n",
      "point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go.  Admiral\n",
      "Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in\n",
      "Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,\n",
      "token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is\n",
      "smoke, must be fire.  But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor\n",
      "Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked\n",
      "to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they\n",
      "gaze; however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate\n",
      "through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what\n",
      "rocks must be shunned.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head\n",
      "standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is\n",
      "not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole\n",
      "historian of Nantucket, stands accountable.  The worthy Obed tells\n",
      "us, that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were\n",
      "regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island\n",
      "erected lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs\n",
      "ascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in\n",
      "a hen-house.  A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay\n",
      "whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to\n",
      "the ready-manned boats nigh the beach.  But this custom has now\n",
      "become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head, that of a\n",
      "whale-ship at sea.  The three mast-heads are kept manned from\n",
      "sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the\n",
      "helm), and relieving each other every two hours.  In the serene\n",
      "weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay,\n",
      "to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful.  There you stand, a\n",
      "hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if\n",
      "the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between your\n",
      "legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships\n",
      "once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes.\n",
      "There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with nothing\n",
      "ruffled but the waves.  The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy\n",
      "trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor.  For the most\n",
      "part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests\n",
      "you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling\n",
      "accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary\n",
      "excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt\n",
      "securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of\n",

      "In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years'\n",
      "voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at\n",
      "the mast-head would amount to several entire months.  And it is much\n",
      "to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a\n",
      "portion of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly\n",
      "destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or\n",

      "to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or\n",
      "any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men\n",
      "temporarily isolate themselves.  Your most usual point of perch is\n",
      "the head of the t' gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin\n",
      "parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t' gallant\n",
      "cross-trees.  Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about\n",
      "as cosy as he would standing on a bull's horns.  To be sure, in cold\n",
      "weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a\n",
      "watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more\n",
      "of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of\n",
      "its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even\n",
      "move out of it, without running great risk of perishing (like an\n",
      "ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat\n",
      "is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional\n",
      "skin encasing you.  You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in\n",

      "\n",
      "It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one\n",
      "morning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the\n",
      "cabin-gangway to the deck.  There most sea-captains usually walk at\n",
      "that hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few\n",
      "turns in the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his\n",
      "old rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all\n",
      "over dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his\n",
      "walk.  Did you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow;\n",
      "there also, you would see still stranger foot-prints--the foot-prints\n",
      "of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as\n",
      "his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark.  And, so full of\n",
      "his thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at\n",
      "the main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that\n",
      "thought turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so\n",
      "completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward\n",
      "mould of every outer movement.\n",

      "\"D'ye mark him, Flask?\" whispered Stubb; \"the chick that's in him\n",

      "the deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "It drew near the close of day.  Suddenly he came to a halt by the\n",
      "bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and\n",
      "with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send\n",
      "everybody aft.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir!\" said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on\n",
      "ship-board except in some extraordinary case.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Send everybody aft,\" repeated Ahab.  \"Mast-heads, there! come down!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the entire ship's company were assembled, and with curious and\n",
      "not wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not\n",
      "unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after\n",
      "rapidly glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among\n",
      "the crew, started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were\n",
      "nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck.  With bent head and\n",
      "half-slouched hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering\n",
      "whispering among the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask,\n",
      "that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing\n",
      "a pedestrian feat.  But this did not last long.  Vehemently pausing,\n",
      "he cried:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?\"\n",

      "clubbed voices.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good!\" cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the\n",

      "\"And what do ye next, men?\"\n",

      "More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the\n",
      "countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began\n",
      "to gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that\n",
      "they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless\n",
      "questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in\n",
      "his pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,\n",
      "almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a\n",
      "white whale.  Look ye! d'ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?\"--holding\n",
      "up a broad bright coin to the sun--\"it is a sixteen dollar piece,\n",
      "men.  D'ye see it?  Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was\n",
      "slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if\n",
      "to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile\n",
      "lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and\n",
      "inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of\n",
      "his vitality in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the\n",
      "main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold\n",
      "with the other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: \"Whosoever\n",
      "of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a\n",
      "crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with\n",
      "three holes punctured in his starboard fluke--look ye, whosoever of\n",
      "ye raises me that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my\n",
      "boys!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Huzza! huzza!\" cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they\n",
      "hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a white whale, I say,\" resumed Ahab, as he threw down the\n",

      "white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even\n",
      "more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention\n",
      "of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was\n",
      "separately touched by some specific recollection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Captain Ahab,\" said Tashtego, \"that white whale must be the same\n",

      "\"Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?\" said\n",
      "the Gay-Header deliberately.\n",

      "and round as though uncorking a bottle--\"like him--him--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Corkscrew!\" cried Ahab, \"aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted\n",

      "whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after\n",
      "the great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like\n",

      "far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last\n",
      "seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder.\n",
      "\"Captain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick--but it was not Moby Dick\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Who told thee that?\" cried Ahab; then pausing, \"Aye, Starbuck; aye,\n",
      "my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick\n",
      "that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now.  Aye, aye,\" he\n",
      "shouted with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a\n",
      "heart-stricken moose; \"Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale\n",
      "that razeed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!\"\n",
      "Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he shouted\n",
      "out: \"Aye, aye! and I'll chase him round Good Hope, and round the\n",
      "Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition's flames\n",
      "before I give him up.  And this is what ye have shipped for, men! to\n",
      "chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all sides of\n",
      "earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out.  What say ye,\n",
      "men, will ye splice hands on it, now?  I think ye do look brave.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye!\" shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the\n",

      "Moby Dick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God bless ye,\" he seemed to half sob and half shout.  \"God bless ye,\n",
      "men.  Steward! go draw the great measure of grog.  But what's this\n",
      "long face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale?\n",
      "art not game for Moby Dick?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too,\n",

      "can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall?\n",
      "To me, the white whale is that wall, shoved near to me.  Sometimes I\n",

      "sinewing it.  That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be\n",
      "the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak\n",

      "And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary\n",

      "naturalists--Olassen and Povelson--declaring the Sperm Whale not only\n",
      "to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to\n",
      "be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human\n",
      "blood.  Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier's, were these or\n",

      "days of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to\n",
      "induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this\n",
      "new and daring warfare; such men protesting that although other\n",
      "leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance\n",
      "at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man.\n",
      "That to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick\n",
      "eternity.  On this head, there are some remarkable documents that may\n",
      "be consulted.\n",

      "Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things\n",
      "were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number\n",
      "who, chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the\n",
      "specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious\n",
      "accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle\n",
      "if offered.\n",

      "One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be\n",
      "linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously\n",

      "that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one\n",
      "and the same instant of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit\n",

      "divulged, even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of\n",
      "the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part,\n",
      "unaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time have originated\n",
      "the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them,\n",
      "especially concerning the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a\n",
      "great depth, he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the\n",
      "most widely distant points.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships,\n",
      "and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by\n",
      "Scoresby, that some whales have been captured far north in the\n",
      "Pacific, in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted\n",
      "in the Greenland seas.  Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of\n",
      "these instances it has been declared that the interval of time\n",
      "between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days.\n",
      "Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen, that the\n",
      "Nor' West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never a problem to\n",
      "the whale.  So that here, in the real living experience of living\n",
      "men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello\n",
      "mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in\n",
      "which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still\n",
      "more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose\n",
      "waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an\n",
      "underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully\n",
      "equalled by the realities of the whalemen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and\n",
      "knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had\n",
      "escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some\n",
      "whalemen should go still further in their superstitions; declaring\n",
      "Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but\n",
      "ubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be planted in\n",
      "his flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should\n",
      "ever be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a\n",

      "his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm\n",
      "whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out--a peculiar snow-white\n",
      "wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump.  These were\n",

      "uncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to\n",
      "those who knew him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with\n",
      "the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his\n",

      "justified by his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through\n",
      "a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all\n",
      "spangled with golden gleamings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet\n",

      "terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to\n",
      "specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his\n",
      "assaults.  More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of\n",
      "dismay than perhaps aught else.  For, when swimming before his\n",
      "exulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had\n",
      "several times been known to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down\n",
      "upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back\n",
      "in consternation to their ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already several fatalities had attended his chase.  But though\n",
      "similar disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means\n",
      "unusual in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White\n",
      "Whale's infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or\n",
      "death that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been\n",
      "inflicted by an unintelligent agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds\n",
      "of his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of\n",

      "exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.\n",
      "\n",
      "His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in\n",

      "beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe\n",
      "one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east\n",
      "reverenced in their statue devil;--Ahab did not fall down and worship\n",

      "purpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the\n",
      "transom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea\n",
      "charts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table.  Then\n",
      "seating himself before it, you would have seen him intently study the\n",
      "various lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but\n",
      "steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were\n",
      "blank.  At intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside\n",
      "him, wherein were set down the seasons and places in which, on\n",
      "various former voyages of various ships, sperm whales had been\n",
      "captured or seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over\n",
      "his head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for\n",
      "ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled\n",
      "brow, till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out\n",

      "also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his\n",
      "forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his\n",
      "cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts.  Almost every night they\n",
      "were brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced,\n",
      "and others were substituted.  For with the charts of all four oceans\n",
      "before him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a\n",
      "view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of\n",
      "his soul.\n",
      "\n",

      "it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary\n",
      "creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet.  But not so did it\n",
      "seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and\n",
      "thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale's food; and,\n",
      "also, calling to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting\n",
      "him in particular latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises,\n",
      "almost approaching to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be\n",
      "upon this or that ground in search of his prey.\n",
      "\n",
      "So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the\n",
      "sperm whale's resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe\n",
      "that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;\n",
      "were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by\n",
      "an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National\n",
      "Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851.  By that circular, it\n",
      "appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and\n",
      "portions of it are presented in the circular.  \"This chart divides\n",
      "the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees\n",
      "of longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are\n",
      "twelve columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each\n",
      "of which districts are three lines; one to show the number of days\n",
      "that have been spent in each month in every district, and the two\n",

      "\n",
      "Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another,\n",
      "the sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct--say, rather,\n",
      "secret intelligence from the Deity--mostly swim in VEINS, as they are\n",
      "called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such\n",
      "undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any\n",
      "chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision.  Though, in these\n",
      "cases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a\n",
      "surveyor's parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly\n",
      "confined to its own unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary\n",
      "VEIN in which at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces\n",
      "some few miles in width (more or less, as the vein is presumed to\n",
      "expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the\n",
      "whale-ship's mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic\n",
      "zone.  The sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth and\n",
      "along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be looked\n",
      "for.\n",
      "\n",
      "And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\n",
      "feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in\n",
      "crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could,\n",
      "by his art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to\n",
      "be wholly without prospect of a meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his\n",
      "delirious but still methodical scheme.  But not so in the reality,\n",
      "perhaps.  Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular\n",
      "seasons for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude\n",
      "that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude\n",
      "this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those\n",
      "that were found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar\n",
      "and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved\n",
      "true.  In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit,\n",
      "applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm\n",
      "whales.  So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for\n",
      "example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean,\n",
      "or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that\n",
      "were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent\n",
      "corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there.  So,\n",
      "too, with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed\n",
      "himself.  But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and\n",
      "ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged abode.  And\n",
      "where Ahab's chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been\n",
      "spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever way-side,\n",
      "antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a particular set time or\n",
      "place were attained, when all possibilities would become\n",
      "probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the\n",
      "next thing to a certainty.  That particular set time and place were\n",
      "conjoined in the one technical phrase--the Season-on-the-Line.  For\n",
      "there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been\n",
      "periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the\n",
      "sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one\n",
      "sign of the Zodiac.  There it was, too, that most of the deadly\n",
      "encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the waves were\n",
      "storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where the\n",
      "monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance.  But\n",
      "in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with\n",
      "which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he\n",
      "would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning\n",
      "fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those hopes;\n",
      "nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his\n",
      "unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of\n",
      "the Season-on-the-Line.  No possible endeavor then could enable her\n",
      "commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and\n",
      "then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial\n",
      "Pacific in time to cruise there.  Therefore, he must wait for the\n",
      "next ensuing season.  Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's sailing\n",
      "had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this\n",
      "very complexion of things.  Because, an interval of three hundred and\n",
      "sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead\n",
      "of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous\n",
      "hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far\n",
      "remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his\n",
      "wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China\n",
      "Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race.  So that Monsoons,\n",
      "Pampas, Nor'-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter\n",
      "and Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag\n",
      "world-circle of the Pequod's circumnavigating wake.\n",
      "\n",
      "But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it\n",
      "not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one\n",
      "solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of\n",
      "individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti\n",
      "in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople?  Yes.  For the\n",
      "peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could\n",
      "not but be unmistakable.  And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab\n",
      "would mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till long\n",
      "after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries--tallied him,\n",
      "and shall he escape?  His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out\n",
      "like a lost sheep's ear!  And here, his mad mind would run on in a\n",

      "whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain, till\n",

      "his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from\n",
      "which forked flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends\n",
      "beckoned him to leap down among them; when this hell in himself\n",

      "with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as though\n",
      "escaping from a bed that was on fire.  Yet these, perhaps, instead of\n",
      "being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright\n",
      "at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity.\n",
      "For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast\n",

      "was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror\n",

      "and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the characterizing\n",
      "mind, which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or\n",
      "agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity\n",
      "of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no longer an\n",
      "integral.  But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the\n",
      "soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab's case, yielding up\n",
      "all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that\n",

      "interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by\n",

      "circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of\n",
      "Africa; but to no purpose.  This man and this whale again came\n",
      "together, and the one vanquished the other.  I say I, myself, have\n",
      "known three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw\n",

      "directly down upon the ship.  Dashing his forehead against her hull,\n",
      "he so stove her in, that in less than \"ten minutes\" she settled down\n",
      "and fell over.  Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since.\n",
      "After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the land in\n",

      "\"By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next\n",
      "day we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh.  The weather\n",
      "was very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged\n",
      "to keep on our fur clothing.  For some days we had very little wind;\n",
      "it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest\n",
      "sprang up.  An uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger\n",
      "than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was\n",
      "not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship,\n",
      "which was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was\n",
      "impossible to prevent its striking against him.  We were thus placed\n",
      "in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature, setting up\n",
      "its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water.  The\n",
      "masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below\n",
      "all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck\n",
      "upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with\n",
      "the utmost gravity and solemnity.  Captain D'Wolf applied immediately\n",
      "to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any\n",
      "damage from the shock, but we found that very happily it had escaped\n",
      "entirely uninjured.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the Captain D'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in\n",
      "question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual\n",
      "adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of\n",
      "Dorchester near Boston.  I have the honour of being a nephew of his.\n",
      "I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in\n",
      "Langsdorff.  He substantiates every word.  The ship, however, was by\n",
      "no means a large one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast,\n",
      "and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he\n",
      "sailed from home.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full,\n",
      "too, of honest wonders--the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient\n",
      "Dampier's old chums--I found a little matter set down so like that\n",
      "just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here\n",
      "for a corroborative example, if such be needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lionel, it seems, was on his way to \"John Ferdinando,\" as he calls\n",
      "the modern Juan Fernandes.  \"In our way thither,\" he says, \"about\n",
      "four o'clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty\n",
      "leagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock,\n",
      "which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell\n",
      "where they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for\n",
      "death.  And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we\n",
      "took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the\n",
      "amazement was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found\n",
      "no ground.  ....  The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in\n",
      "their carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their\n",
      "hammocks.  Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown\n",
      "out of his cabin!\"  Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an\n",
      "earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that\n",
      "a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great\n",
      "mischief along the Spanish land.  But I should not much wonder if, in\n",
      "the darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after\n",
      "all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from\n",
      "beneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known\n",
      "to me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale.  In\n",
      "more than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the\n",
      "assailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself,\n",
      "and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks.  The\n",
      "English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for\n",
      "his strength, let me say, that there have been examples where the\n",
      "lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been\n",
      "transferred to the ship, and secured there; the whale towing her\n",
      "great hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart.\n",
      "Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once\n",
      "struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with\n",
      "blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his\n",
      "pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his\n",
      "character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his\n",
      "mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive\n",
      "minutes.  But I must be content with only one more and a concluding\n",

      "these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so\n",

      "In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian\n",
      "magistrate of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor\n",
      "and Belisarius general.  As many know, he wrote the history of his\n",
      "own times, a work every way of uncommon value.  By the best\n",
      "authorities, he has always been considered a most trustworthy and\n",
      "unexaggerating historian, except in some one or two particulars, not\n",
      "at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term\n",
      "of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured\n",
      "in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having\n",
      "destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more\n",
      "than fifty years.  A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot\n",
      "easily be gainsaid.  Nor is there any reason it should be.  Of what\n",
      "precise species this sea-monster was, is not mentioned.  But as he\n",
      "destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a\n",
      "whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale.  And I will\n",
      "tell you why.  For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had\n",
      "been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters\n",
      "connecting with it.  Even now I am certain that those seas are not,\n",
      "and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a\n",
      "place for his habitual gregarious resort.  But further investigations\n",
      "have recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been\n",
      "isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the\n",
      "Mediterranean.  I am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary\n",
      "coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a\n",
      "sperm whale.  Now, as a vessel of war readily passes through the\n",
      "Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route, pass out\n",
      "of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar\n",
      "substance called BRIT is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.\n",
      "But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm\n",
      "whale--squid or cuttle-fish--lurks at the bottom of that sea, because\n",
      "large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been\n",
      "found at its surface.  If, then, you properly put these statements\n",
      "together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,\n",
      "according to all human reasoning, Procopius's sea-monster, that for\n",
      "half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all\n",
      "probability have been a sperm whale.\n",

      "Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his\n",

      "Dick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to\n",
      "that one passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature\n",
      "and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman's ways,\n",
      "altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage.  Or\n",
      "at least if this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives\n",
      "much more influential with him.  It would be refining too much,\n",
      "perhaps, even considering his monomania, to hint that his\n",
      "vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended\n",
      "itself in some degree to all sperm whales, and that the more monsters\n",
      "he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each\n",
      "subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he\n",
      "hunted.  But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there\n",
      "were still additional considerations which, though not so strictly\n",
      "according with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no\n",
      "means incapable of swaying him.\n",
      "\n",
      "To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used\n",
      "in the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order.  He\n",
      "knew, for example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some\n",

      "complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority\n",

      "intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation.  Starbuck's\n",
      "body and Starbuck's coerced will were Ahab's, so long as Ahab kept\n",
      "his magnet at Starbuck's brain; still he knew that for all this the\n",
      "chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain's quest, and could he,\n",
      "would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it.\n",
      "It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was\n",
      "seen.  During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall\n",
      "into open relapses of rebellion against his captain's leadership,\n",
      "unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were\n",
      "brought to bear upon him.  Not only that, but the subtle insanity of\n",
      "Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested\n",
      "than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for\n",
      "the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange\n",
      "imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the full\n",
      "terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure\n",
      "background (for few men's courage is proof against protracted\n",
      "meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long\n",

      "think of than Moby Dick.  For however eagerly and impetuously the\n",
      "savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors\n",
      "of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable--they live in\n",
      "the varying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness--and when\n",
      "retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however\n",
      "promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things\n",
      "requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene\n",
      "and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing.  In times of strong emotion\n",
      "mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are\n",
      "evanescent.  The permanent constitutional condition of the\n",
      "manufactured man, thought Ahab, is sordidness.  Granting that the\n",
      "White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew, and\n",
      "playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous\n",
      "knight-errantism in them, still, while for the love of it they give\n",
      "chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food for their more common,\n",
      "daily appetites.  For even the high lifted and chivalric Crusaders of\n",
      "old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to\n",
      "fight for their holy sepulchre, without committing burglaries,\n",
      "picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by the way.  Had\n",
      "they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object--that\n",
      "final and romantic object, too many would have turned from in\n",
      "disgust.  I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all hopes of\n",

      "somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the\n",
      "Pequod's voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing,\n",
      "he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of\n",
      "usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew\n",
      "if so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further\n",

      "From even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the\n",
      "possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground,\n",

      "For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be\n",

      "giving his orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat\n",
      "actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt--above\n",

      "working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small\n",
      "gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet\n",
      "continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any\n",

      "his brow.  Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed\n",
      "Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated\n",
      "state, I know not; but so it happened.  Intolerably striding along\n",
      "the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the\n",
      "planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters\n",
      "consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.\n",

      "of ships actually foundering at the time.  Such, gentlemen, is the\n",
      "inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in\n",

      "their faces.  But in all vessels this broom business is the\n",
      "prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard.  Besides,\n",
      "it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into\n",
      "gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman\n",
      "of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of\n",
      "the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial\n",
      "business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the\n",
      "case with his comrades.  I mention all these particulars so that you\n",
      "may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost\n",

      "spat in his face.  Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\n",
      "understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman\n",
      "fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command.  But as he sat\n",
      "still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's\n",
      "malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in\n",
      "him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he\n",
      "instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and\n",
      "unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already\n",
      "ireful being--a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really\n",

      "then, without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three\n",
      "lads as the customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the\n",
      "pumps, had done little or nothing all day.  To this, Radney replied\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\n",
      "followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated\n",

      "not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with\n",
      "his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it\n",

      "yourself.'  But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him,\n",

      "inch of his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable\n",
      "maledictions.  Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch;\n",
      "stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance,\n",
      "Steelkilt, clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing\n",

      "of the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to some fears of\n",

      "the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his\n",
      "babbling and betake himself where he belonged.  On the fifth morning\n",

      "as black as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt\n",
      "proposed to the two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with\n",

      "order to be the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to\n",

      "lifted his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it\n",
      "had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads.  All was\n",

      "the sea, on the other flank of the whale.  He struck out through the\n",
      "spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly\n",
      "seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick.  But the whale\n",

      "It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions\n",

      "are pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and\n",
      "maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent\n",

      "This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts.\n",
      "First: In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional\n",
      "line from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound\n",
      "so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally\n",
      "attached to the harpoon.  In these instances, the whale of course is\n",
      "shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the\n",
      "other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its\n",
      "consort.  Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common\n",
      "safety's sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached\n",
      "to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the end\n",
      "almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not\n",
      "stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down\n",
      "after him into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no\n",
      "town-crier would ever find her again.\n",

      "Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is\n",
      "taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is\n",
      "again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting\n",
      "crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man's oar, so that it jogs\n",
      "against his wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as\n",
      "they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks\n",
      "or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden\n",
      "pin or skewer the size of a common quill, prevents it from slipping\n",
      "out.  From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and\n",
      "is then passed inside the boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms\n",
      "(called box-line) being coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues\n",
      "its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and is then\n",
      "attached to the short-warp--the rope which is immediately connected\n",
      "with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the short-warp goes\n",
      "through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.\n",

      "that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these\n",

      "business of towing the trophy to the Pequod.  And now, as we eighteen\n",
      "men with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and\n",
      "fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish\n",
      "corpse in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at\n",
      "long intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the\n",

      "Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod's\n",

      "that part is relatively heavier than any other (excepting the\n",

      "end is secured to the ship.  By adroit management the wooden float is\n",
      "made to rise on the other side of the mass, so that now having\n",

      "quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the\n",

      "deck:--where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance\n",
      "to study practical cetology than here?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between\n",
      "these heads.  Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there\n",
      "is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale's which the\n",
      "Right Whale's sadly lacks.  There is more character in the Sperm\n",
      "Whale's head.  As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense\n",
      "superiority to him, in point of pervading dignity.  In the present\n",
      "instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt\n",
      "colour of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and\n",
      "large experience.  In short, he is what the fishermen technically\n",
      "call a \"grey-headed whale.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads--namely, the\n",
      "two most important organs, the eye and the ear.  Far back on the side\n",
      "of the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale's jaw, if\n",
      "you narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you\n",
      "would fancy to be a young colt's eye; so out of all proportion is it\n",
      "to the magnitude of the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale's eyes, it is\n",
      "plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more\n",
      "than he can one exactly astern.  In a word, the position of the\n",
      "whale's eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears; and you may fancy,\n",
      "for yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey\n",
      "objects through your ears.  You would find that you could only\n",
      "command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight\n",
      "side-line of sight; and about thirty more behind it.  If your\n",
      "bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with dagger uplifted\n",
      "in broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more than if he\n",
      "were stealing upon you from behind.  In a word, you would have two\n",
      "backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side\n",
      "fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man--what, indeed,\n",
      "but his eyes?\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the\n",
      "eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so\n",
      "as to produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar\n",
      "position of the whale's eyes, effectually divided as they are by many\n",
      "cubic feet of solid head, which towers between them like a great\n",
      "mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must\n",
      "wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts.\n",
      "The whale, therefore, must see one distinct picture on this side,\n",
      "and another distinct picture on that side; while all between must be\n",
      "profound darkness and nothingness to him.  Man may, in effect, be\n",
      "said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two joined\n",
      "sashes for his window.  But with the whale, these two sashes are\n",
      "separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing\n",
      "the view.  This peculiarity of the whale's eyes is a thing always to\n",
      "be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader\n",
      "in some subsequent scenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\n",
      "visual matter as touching the Leviathan.  But I must be content with\n",
      "a hint.  So long as a man's eyes are open in the light, the act of\n",
      "seeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically\n",
      "seeing whatever objects are before him.  Nevertheless, any one's\n",
      "experience will teach him, that though he can take in an\n",
      "undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite\n",
      "impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to examine any two\n",
      "things--however large or however small--at one and the same instant\n",
      "of time; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other.\n",
      "But if you now come to separate these two objects, and surround each\n",
      "by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one of them,\n",
      "in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will\n",
      "be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness.  How is it,\n",
      "then, with the whale?  True, both his eyes, in themselves, must\n",
      "simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,\n",
      "combining, and subtle than man's, that he can at the same moment of\n",
      "time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of\n",
      "him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction?  If he can, then\n",
      "is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able\n",
      "simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct\n",
      "problems in Euclid.  Nor, strictly investigated, is there any\n",
      "incongruity in this comparison.\n",

      "It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\n",
      "extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when\n",
      "beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer\n",
      "frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly\n",

      "an entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads\n",
      "for hours, and never discover that organ.  The ear has no external\n",
      "leaf whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a\n",
      "quill, so wondrously minute is it.  It is lodged a little behind the\n",
      "eye.  With respect to their ears, this important difference is to be\n",

      "partly turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his\n",

      "for the time.  At this juncture the Pequod's keels had shot by the\n",
      "three German boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had,\n",
      "Derick's boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his\n",

      "already so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron\n",
      "before they could completely overtake and pass him.  As for Derick,\n",
      "he seemed quite confident that this would be the case, and\n",
      "occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the\n",

      "It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight.  The whale was\n",

      "fright.  Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering\n",
      "flight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically\n",
      "sank in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating\n",
      "fin.  So have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted\n",

      "known her fear; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was\n",
      "chained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice, save that choking\n",

      "unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis\n",
      "jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the stoutest man\n",
      "who so pitied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod's\n",
      "boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game,\n",
      "Derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually\n",

      "\n",
      "But the monster's run was a brief one.  Giving a sudden gasp, he\n",
      "tumultuously sounded.  With a grating rush, the three lines flew\n",
      "round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in\n",
      "them; while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding\n",
      "would soon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might,\n",
      "they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at\n",
      "last--owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of\n",

      "to sound, for some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of\n",
      "expending more line, though the position was a little ticklish.  But\n",
      "though boats have been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is\n",
      "this \"holding on,\" as it is called; this hooking up by the sharp\n",
      "barbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is that often torments\n",
      "the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his\n",
      "foes.  Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be\n",
      "doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but\n",
      "reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under\n",
      "water, the more he is exhausted.  Because, owing to the enormous\n",
      "surface of him--in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000\n",
      "square feet--the pressure of the water is immense.  We all know what\n",
      "an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even\n",
      "here, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a\n",
      "whale, bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean!\n",
      "It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres.  One whaleman\n",
      "has estimated it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships, with\n",
      "all their guns, and stores, and men on board.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down\n",
      "into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any\n",
      "sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its\n",
      "depths; what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that\n",
      "silence and placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing\n",
      "and wrenching in agony!  Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were\n",
      "visible at the bows.  Seems it credible that by three such thin\n",
      "threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an\n",
      "eight day clock.  Suspended? and to what?  To three bits of board.\n",
      "Is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said--\"Canst\n",
      "thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish-spears?\n",
      "The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold, the spear, the dart,\n",
      "nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron as straw; the arrow cannot make\n",

      "\n",
      "In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats\n",
      "sent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad\n",
      "enough to shade half Xerxes' army.  Who can tell how appalling to the\n",

      "head!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stand by, men; he stirs,\" cried Starbuck, as the three lines\n",
      "suddenly vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to\n",
      "them, as by magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale,\n",
      "so that every oarsman felt them in his seat.  The next moment,\n",
      "relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows, the\n",
      "boats gave a sudden bounce upwards, as a small icefield will, when a\n",
      "dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Haul in!  Haul in!\" cried Starbuck again; \"he's rising.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand's breadth\n",
      "could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all\n",
      "dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two\n",
      "ship's lengths of the hunters.\n",
      "\n",
      "His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion.  In most land\n",
      "animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their\n",
      "veins, whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least\n",
      "instantly shut off in certain directions.  Not so with the whale; one\n",
      "of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure\n",
      "of the blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point\n",
      "as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole\n",
      "arterial system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary\n",
      "pressure of water at a great distance below the surface, his life may\n",
      "be said to pour from him in incessant streams.  Yet so vast is the\n",
      "quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior\n",
      "fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a\n",
      "considerable period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose\n",
      "source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills.\n",
      "Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew\n",
      "over his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him, they\n",
      "were followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept\n",
      "continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was\n",
      "only at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture\n",
      "into the air.  From this last vent no blood yet came, because no\n",
      "vital part of him had thus far been struck.  His life, as they\n",
      "significantly call it, was untouched.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of\n",
      "his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly\n",
      "revealed.  His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been,\n",
      "were beheld.  As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of\n",
      "the noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale's\n",
      "eyes had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable\n",
      "to see.  But pity there was none.  For all his old age, and his one\n",
      "arm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in\n",
      "order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and\n",
      "also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional\n",
      "inoffensiveness by all to all.  Still rolling in his blood, at last\n",
      "he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance,\n",
      "the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A nice spot,\" cried Flask; \"just let me prick him there once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Avast!\" cried Starbuck, \"there's no need of that!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But humane Starbuck was too late.  At the instant of the dart an\n",
      "ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more\n",
      "than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with\n",
      "swift fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their\n",
      "glorying crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask's boat\n",
      "and marring the bows.  It was his death stroke.  For, by this time,\n",
      "so spent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from\n",
      "the wreck he had made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped\n",
      "with his stumped fin, then over and over slowly revolved like a\n",
      "waning world; turned up the white secrets of his belly; lay like a\n",
      "log, and died.  It was most piteous, that last expiring spout.  As\n",
      "when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some\n",
      "mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the\n",
      "spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground--so the last long dying\n",
      "spout of the whale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body\n",
      "showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.\n",
      "Immediately, by Starbuck's orders, lines were secured to it at\n",
      "different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken\n",
      "whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords.  By\n",
      "very heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was\n",
      "transferred to her side, and was strongly secured there by the\n",
      "stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially\n",
      "upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the\n",
      "spade, the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in\n",
      "his flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described.  But as\n",
      "the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of\n",
      "captured whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no\n",
      "prominence of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must\n",
      "needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully\n",
      "to account for the ulceration alluded to.  But still more curious was\n",
      "the fact of a lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from\n",
      "the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm about it.  Who had darted\n",
      "that stone lance?  And when?  It might have been darted by some Nor'\n",
      "West Indian long before America was discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous\n",
      "cabinet there is no telling.  But a sudden stop was put to further\n",
      "discoveries, by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over\n",
      "sideways to the sea, owing to the body's immensely increasing\n",
      "tendency to sink.  However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of\n",
      "affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it so resolutely,\n",
      "indeed, that when at length the ship would have been capsized, if\n",
      "still persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when the\n",
      "command was given to break clear from it, such was the immovable\n",
      "strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables\n",
      "were fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off.  Meantime\n",
      "everything in the Pequod was aslant.  To cross to the other side of\n",
      "the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house.  The\n",
      "ship groaned and gasped.  Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks\n",
      "and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural\n",
      "dislocation.  In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon\n",
      "the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads;\n",
      "and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could\n",
      "not be at all approached, while every moment whole tons of\n",
      "ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on\n",
      "the point of going over.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold on, hold on, won't ye?\" cried Stubb to the body, \"don't be in\n",
      "such a devil of a hurry to sink!  By thunder, men, we must do\n",
      "something or go for it.  No use prying there; avast, I say with your\n",
      "handspikes, and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and\n",
      "cut the big chains.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Knife?  Aye, aye,\" cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter's heavy\n",
      "hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began\n",
      "slashing at the largest fluke-chains.  But a few strokes, full of\n",
      "sparks, were given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest.\n",
      "With a terrific snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted,\n",
      "the carcase sank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm\n",
      "Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately\n",
      "accounted for it.  Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great\n",
      "buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the\n",
      "surface.  If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and\n",
      "broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their\n",
      "bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert\n",
      "that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the\n",
      "fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in\n",

      "embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which\n",

      "fishermen have this saying, \"A penny roll would choke him\"; his\n",
      "swallow is so very small.  But, to this, Bishop Jebb's anticipative\n",
      "answer is ready.  It is not necessary, hints the Bishop, that we\n",
      "consider Jonah as tombed in the whale's belly, but as temporarily\n",
      "lodged in some part of his mouth.  And this seems reasonable enough\n",
      "in the good Bishop.  For truly, the Right Whale's mouth would\n",
      "accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the\n",
      "players.  Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a\n",

      "in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale's gastric juices.\n",
      "But this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German\n",
      "exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating\n",
      "body of a DEAD whale--even as the French soldiers in the Russian\n",
      "campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them.\n",
      "Besides, it has been divined by other continental commentators, that\n",
      "when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway\n",
      "effected his escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a\n",
      "whale for a figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called \"The\n",

      "of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it\n",
      "comprises upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty\n",
      "square feet.  The compact round body of its root expands into two\n",
      "broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less\n",
      "than an inch in thickness.  At the crotch or junction, these flukes\n",
      "slightly overlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings,\n",
      "leaving a wide vacancy between.  In no living thing are the lines of\n",
      "beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of\n",
      "these flukes.  At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale, the\n",
      "tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut\n",
      "into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:--upper,\n",
      "middle, and lower.  The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are\n",
      "long and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running\n",
      "crosswise between the outside layers.  This triune structure, as much\n",
      "as anything else, imparts power to the tail.  To the student of old\n",
      "Roman walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the\n",
      "thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those\n",
      "wonderful relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so\n",
      "much to the great strength of the masonry.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not\n",
      "enough, the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and\n",
      "woof of muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side\n",
      "the loins and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with\n",
      "them, and largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the\n",
      "confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to\n",
      "a point.  Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to\n",
      "do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor does this--its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the\n",
      "graceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease\n",

      "sweeping; Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.\n",
      "\n",
      "First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan's tail acts in\n",
      "a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures.  It\n",
      "never wriggles.  In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority.\n",
      "To the whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion.  Scroll-wise\n",
      "coiled forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards,\n",
      "it is this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the\n",
      "monster when furiously swimming.  His side-fins only serve to steer\n",
      "by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only\n",
      "fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in\n",
      "his conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail.\n",
      "In striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and\n",
      "the blow is only inflicted by the recoil.  If it be made in the\n",
      "unobstructed air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is\n",
      "then simply irresistible.  No ribs of man or boat can withstand it.\n",
      "Your only salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways\n",
      "through the opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy\n",
      "of the whale boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked\n",
      "rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is\n",
      "generally the most serious result.  These submerged side blows are so\n",
      "often received in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child's\n",
      "play.  Some one strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale\n",
      "the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect\n",
      "there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the\n",
      "elephant's trunk.  This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of\n",
      "sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft\n",
      "slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of\n",
      "the sea; and if he feel but a sailor's whisker, woe to that sailor,\n",
      "whiskers and all.  What tenderness there is in that preliminary\n",
      "touch!  Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway\n",
      "bethink me of Darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the\n",
      "flower-market, and with low salutations presented nosegays to\n",
      "damsels, and then caressed their zones.  On more accounts than one, a\n",
      "pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in\n",
      "his tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded\n",
      "in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of\n",
      "the middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast\n",
      "corpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as\n",
      "if it were a hearth.  But still you see his power in his play.  The\n",
      "broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting\n",
      "the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles.  You would\n",
      "almost think a great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the\n",
      "light wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity, you\n",
      "would think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the\n",
      "flukes lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then\n",
      "completely out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to\n",
      "plunge into the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of\n",
      "his body are tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a\n",
      "moment, till they downwards shoot out of view.  Excepting the sublime\n",
      "BREACH--somewhere else to be described--this peaking of the whale's\n",
      "flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated\n",
      "nature.  Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems\n",
      "spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven.  So in dreams, have I\n",
      "seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from\n",
      "the flame Baltic of Hell.  But in gazing at such scenes, it is all in\n",
      "all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the devils will occur to\n",
      "you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels.  Standing at the mast-head\n",
      "of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a\n",
      "large herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the sun, and\n",
      "for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes.  As it seemed\n",
      "to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods\n",
      "was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire worshippers.\n",
      "As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant, I then\n",
      "testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all\n",
      "beings.  For according to King Juba, the military elephants of\n",
      "antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the\n",
      "profoundest silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the\n",
      "elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk\n",
      "of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two\n",
      "opposite organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they\n",
      "respectively belong.  For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier\n",
      "to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan's tail, his trunk is but\n",
      "the stalk of a lily.  The most direful blow from the elephant's trunk\n",

      "how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding\n",
      "her on to her own chosen pursuit,--mere riding-whips and rowels to\n",
      "her, that they were.  As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced\n",
      "the deck; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and\n",
      "in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such\n",
      "fancy as the above seemed his.  And when he glanced upon the green\n",
      "walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing, and\n",
      "bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance,\n",
      "and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both chasing\n",
      "and being chased to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of\n",
      "remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were\n",
      "infernally cheering him on with their curses;--when all these\n",
      "conceits had passed through his brain, Ahab's brow was left gaunt and\n",
      "ribbed, like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been\n",
      "gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm thing from its place.\n",
      "\n",
      "But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and\n",
      "when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the\n",
      "Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra\n",
      "side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the\n",
      "harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been\n",
      "gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so\n",

      "gradually the ship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was\n",
      "passed to spring to the boats.  But no sooner did the herd, by some\n",
      "presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of\n",
      "the three keels that were after them,--though as yet a mile in their\n",
      "rear,--than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and\n",
      "battalions, so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of\n",
      "stacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and\n",
      "after several hours' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the\n",
      "chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave\n",
      "animating token that they were now at last under the influence of\n",
      "that strange perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the\n",
      "fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say he is gallied.  The\n",
      "compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and\n",
      "steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout; and\n",
      "like King Porus' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they\n",
      "seemed going mad with consternation.  In all directions expanding in\n",
      "vast irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by\n",
      "their short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction\n",
      "of panic.  This was still more strangely evinced by those of their\n",
      "number, who, completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like\n",
      "water-logged dismantled ships on the sea.  Had these Leviathans been\n",
      "but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce\n",
      "wolves, they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay.\n",
      "But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding\n",
      "creatures.  Though banding together in tens of thousands, the\n",
      "lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary\n",
      "horseman.  Witness, too, all human beings, how when herded together\n",
      "in the sheepfold of a theatre's pit, they will, at the slightest\n",
      "alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,\n",
      "trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death.\n",
      "Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied\n",
      "whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth\n",
      "which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,\n",
      "yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced\n",
      "nor retreated, but collectively remained in one place.  As is\n",
      "customary in those cases, the boats at once separated, each making\n",
      "for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal.  In about\n",
      "three minutes' time, Queequeg's harpoon was flung; the stricken fish\n",
      "darted blinding spray in our faces, and then running away with us like\n",
      "light, steered straight for the heart of the herd.  Though such a\n",
      "movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances, is\n",
      "in no wise unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less\n",
      "anticipated; yet does it present one of the more perilous\n",
      "vicissitudes of the fishery.  For as the swift monster drags you\n",
      "deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to\n",
      "circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.\n",
      "\n",
      "As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power\n",
      "of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him;\n",
      "as we thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we\n",
      "flew, by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset\n",
      "boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving\n",
      "to steer through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at\n",
      "what moment it may be locked in and crushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off\n",
      "from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging\n",
      "away from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while\n",
      "all the time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking\n",
      "out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for\n",
      "there was no time to make long ones.  Nor were the oarsmen quite\n",
      "idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with.\n",
      "They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business.  \"Out of\n",
      "the way, Commodore!\" cried one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden\n",
      "rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant threatened to swamp\n",
      "us.  \"Hard down with your tail, there!\" cried a second to another,\n",
      "which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself with his\n",
      "own fan-like extremity.\n",
      "\n",
      "All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally\n",
      "invented by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs.  Two thick squares\n",
      "of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they\n",
      "cross each other's grain at right angles; a line of considerable\n",
      "length is then attached to the middle of this block, and the other\n",
      "end of the line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a\n",
      "harpoon.  It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used.\n",
      "For then, more whales are close round you than you can possibly\n",
      "chase at one time.  But sperm whales are not every day encountered;\n",
      "while you may, then, you must kill all you can.  And if you cannot\n",
      "kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be\n",
      "afterwards killed at your leisure.  Hence it is, that at times like\n",
      "these the drugg, comes into requisition.  Our boat was furnished with\n",
      "three of them.  The first and second were successfully darted, and we\n",
      "saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous\n",
      "sidelong resistance of the towing drugg.  They were cramped like\n",
      "malefactors with the chain and ball.  But upon flinging the third, in\n",
      "the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under\n",
      "one of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and\n",
      "carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the\n",
      "seat slid from under him.  On both sides the sea came in at the\n",
      "wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in,\n",
      "and so stopped the leaks for the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were\n",
      "it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale's way greatly\n",
      "diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from\n",
      "the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning.\n",
      "So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing\n",
      "whale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting\n",
      "momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of\n",
      "the shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene\n",
      "valley lake.  Here the storms in the roaring glens between the\n",
      "outermost whales, were heard but not felt.  In this central expanse\n",
      "the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek,\n",
      "produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more\n",
      "quiet moods.  Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say\n",
      "lurks at the heart of every commotion.  And still in the distracted\n",
      "distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and\n",
      "saw successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going\n",
      "round and round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so\n",
      "closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might\n",
      "easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have gone round on\n",
      "their backs.  Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales,\n",
      "more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd, no\n",
      "possible chance of escape was at present afforded us.  We must watch\n",
      "for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had\n",
      "only admitted us in order to shut us up.  Keeping at the centre of\n",
      "the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves;\n",
      "the women and children of this routed host.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving\n",
      "outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods\n",
      "in any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture,\n",
      "embraced by the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or\n",
      "three square miles.  At any rate--though indeed such a test at such a\n",
      "time might be deceptive--spoutings might be discovered from our low\n",
      "boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon.  I\n",
      "mention this circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had\n",
      "been purposely locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide\n",
      "extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the\n",
      "precise cause of its stopping; or, possibly, being so young,\n",
      "unsophisticated, and every way innocent and inexperienced; however it\n",
      "may have been, these smaller whales--now and then visiting our\n",
      "becalmed boat from the margin of the lake--evinced a wondrous\n",
      "fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic which it\n",
      "was impossible not to marvel at.  Like household dogs they came\n",
      "snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till\n",
      "it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them.\n",
      "Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs with\n",
      "his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the time refrained\n",
      "from darting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and\n",
      "still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side.  For,\n",
      "suspended in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing\n",
      "mothers of the whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed\n",
      "shortly to become mothers.  The lake, as I have hinted, was to a\n",
      "considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as human infants\n",
      "while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as\n",

      "Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to\n",
      "the Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the\n",
      "stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited\n",
      "ignoramus, who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable\n",
      "a pickle.  Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the\n",
      "Guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the\n",
      "ambergris.  He therefore held his peace on that head, but otherwise\n",
      "was quite frank and confidential with him, so that the two quickly\n",
      "concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the\n",
      "Captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity.\n",
      "According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under\n",

      "velvet vest with watch-seals at his side.  To this gentleman, Stubb\n",
      "was now politely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once\n",
      "ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall I say to him first?\" said he.\n",
      "\n",

      "Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.\n",

      "\n",
      "Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his\n",

      "to us.\"\n",

      "in his boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out\n",
      "the lighter whale of the two from the ship's side.  While the\n",
      "Frenchman's boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way,\n",
      "Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way,\n",
      "ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the\n",
      "whale; hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance,\n",

      "Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to\n",
      "give notice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of\n",
      "his unrighteous cunning.  Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced\n",
      "an excavation in the body, a little behind the side fin.  You would\n",
      "almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and\n",
      "when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like\n",
      "turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam.\n",
      "His boat's crew were all in high excitement, eagerly helping their\n",
      "chief, and looking as anxious as gold-hunters.\n",
      "\n",
      "And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and\n",
      "screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them.  Stubb was\n",
      "beginning to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay\n",
      "increased, when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague,\n",
      "there stole a faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide\n",
      "of bad smells without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow\n",
      "into and then along with another, without at all blending with it for\n",
      "a time.\n",

      "\"I have it, I have it,\" cried Stubb, with delight, striking something\n",
      "in the subterranean regions, \"a purse! a purse!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of\n",
      "something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old\n",
      "cheese; very unctuous and savory withal.  You might easily dent it\n",
      "with your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour.  And\n",
      "this, good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any\n",

      "lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured\n",

      "Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as\n",
      "an article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain\n",
      "Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on\n",
      "that subject.  For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively\n",
      "late day, the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber\n",
      "itself, a problem to the learned.  Though the word ambergris is but\n",
      "the French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite\n",
      "distinct.  For amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also\n",
      "dug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found\n",
      "except upon the sea.  Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle,\n",
      "odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and\n",
      "ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and\n",
      "spicy, that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious\n",
      "candles, hair-powders, and pomatum.  The Turks use it in cooking, and\n",
      "also carry it to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is\n",
      "carried to St. Peter's in Rome.  Some wine merchants drop a few\n",
      "grains into claret, to flavor it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should\n",
      "regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a\n",
      "sick whale!  Yet so it is.  By some, ambergris is supposed to be the\n",
      "cause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale.  How\n",
      "to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering\n",
      "three or four boat loads of Brandreth's pills, and then running out\n",
      "of harm's way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,\n",
      "certain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might\n",
      "be sailors' trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they\n",
      "were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that\n",
      "manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be\n",
      "found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing?  Bethink thee of\n",
      "that saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and\n",
      "incorruption; how that we are sown in dishonour, but raised in glory.\n",

      "I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but\n",
      "cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against\n",
      "whalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds,\n",
      "might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said\n",
      "of the Frenchman's two whales.  Elsewhere in this volume the\n",
      "slanderous aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling\n",
      "is throughout a slatternly, untidy business.  But there is another\n",
      "thing to rebut.  They hint that all whales always smell bad.  Now how\n",
      "did this odious stigma originate?\n",
      "\n",
      "I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the\n",
      "Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago.\n",
      "Because those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their\n",
      "oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the\n",
      "fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of\n",
      "large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the\n",
      "season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which\n",
      "they are exposed, forbidding any other course.  The consequence is,\n",
      "that upon breaking into the hold, and unloading one of these whale\n",
      "cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat\n",
      "similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave-yard, for\n",
      "the foundations of a Lying-in-Hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be\n",
      "likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in\n",
      "former times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg,\n",
      "which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in\n",
      "his great work on Smells, a text-book on that subject.  As its name\n",
      "imports (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in\n",
      "order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to\n",
      "be tried out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose.\n",
      "It was a collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when\n",
      "the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very\n",
      "pleasant savor.  But all this is quite different with a South Sea\n",
      "Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after\n",
      "completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume\n",
      "fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that it\n",
      "is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.  The truth is, that living or\n",
      "dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means\n",
      "creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people\n",
      "of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the\n",
      "nose.  Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,\n",
      "when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking\n",
      "abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true,\n",
      "seldom in the open air.  I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale's\n",
      "flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented lady\n",
      "rustles her dress in a warm parlor.  What then shall I liken the\n",
      "Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude?  Must it not\n",
      "be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with\n",

      "genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever\n",

      "even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous ebony,\n",
      "panelled in king's cabinets.  But Pip loved life, and all life's\n",
      "peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he\n",
      "had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred\n",
      "his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus\n",
      "temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly\n",
      "illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to\n",

      "jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he\n",
      "lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the\n",
      "sun, but by some unnatural gases.  Then come out those fiery\n",
      "effulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once\n",
      "the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel\n",
      "stolen from the King of Hell.  But let us to the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb's after-oarsman\n",
      "chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;\n",
      "and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;\n",
      "but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and\n",
      "therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb\n",
      "observing him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his\n",
      "courageousness to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as\n",
      "the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which\n",
      "happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat.  The\n",
      "involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in\n",
      "hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack\n",
      "whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with\n",
      "him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the\n",
      "water.  That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the\n",
      "line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up\n",
      "to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line,\n",
      "which had taken several turns around his chest and neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tashtego stood in the bows.  He was full of the fire of the hunt.  He\n",
      "hated Pip for a poltroon.  Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,\n",
      "he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,\n",
      "exclaimed interrogatively, \"Cut?\"  Meantime Pip's blue, choked face\n",
      "plainly looked, Do, for God's sake!  All passed in a flash.  In less\n",
      "than half a minute, this entire thing happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Damn him, cut!\" roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was\n",
      "saved.\n",
      "\n",
      "So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed\n",
      "by yells and execrations from the crew.  Tranquilly permitting these\n",
      "irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain,\n",
      "business-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially;\n",
      "and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome advice.  The\n",
      "substance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except--but all the rest\n",
      "was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is.  Now, in general,\n",
      "STICK TO THE BOAT, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will\n",
      "sometimes happen when LEAP FROM THE BOAT, is still better.  Moreover,\n",
      "as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted\n",
      "conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a\n",
      "margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice,\n",
      "and concluded with a peremptory command, \"Stick to the boat, Pip, or\n",
      "by the Lord, I won't pick you up if you jump; mind that.  We can't\n",
      "afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for\n",
      "thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama.  Bear that in mind, and\n",
      "don't jump any more.\"  Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that\n",
      "though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which\n",
      "propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again.  It\n",
      "was under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but\n",
      "this time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale\n",
      "started to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried\n",
      "traveller's trunk.  Alas!  Stubb was but too true to his word.  It\n",
      "was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and\n",
      "cool, and flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like\n",
      "gold-beater's skin hammered out to the extremest.  Bobbing up and\n",
      "down in that sea, Pip's ebon head showed like a head of cloves.  No\n",
      "boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern.  Stubb's\n",
      "inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged.  In\n",
      "three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and\n",
      "Stubb.  Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp,\n",
      "curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the\n",
      "loftiest and the brightest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the\n",
      "practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore.  But the\n",
      "awful lonesomeness is intolerable.  The intense concentration of self\n",
      "in the middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it?\n",
      "Mark, how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea--mark\n",
      "how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate?\n",

      "standing in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed\n",
      "to the stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own\n",
      "boat's bow.  He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured,\n",
      "fine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious\n",

      "\"Hast seen the White Whale!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his\n",
      "crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the\n",
      "stranger.  But here a curious difficulty presented itself.  In the\n",
      "excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of\n",
      "his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but\n",
      "his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy\n",
      "mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be\n",
      "rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment's warning.  Now,\n",
      "it is no very easy matter for anybody--except those who are almost\n",
      "hourly used to it, like whalemen--to clamber up a ship's side from a\n",
      "boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift the boat high up\n",
      "towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it half way down\n",
      "to the kelson.  So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of\n",
      "course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab\n",
      "now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again;\n",
      "hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope\n",
      "to attain.\n",

      "It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward\n",
      "circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his\n",
      "luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab.\n",
      "And in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of\n",
      "the two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the\n",
      "perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him\n",
      "a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not\n",
      "seem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a\n",
      "cripple to use their sea bannisters.  But this awkwardness only\n",
      "lasted a minute, because the strange captain, observing at a glance\n",
      "how affairs stood, cried out, \"I see, I see!--avast heaving there!\n",
      "Jump, boys, and swing over the cutting-tackle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or\n",
      "two previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive\n",
      "curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the\n",
      "end.  This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it\n",
      "all, slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like\n",
      "sitting in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree),\n",
      "and then giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time\n",
      "also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon\n",
      "one of the running parts of the tackle.  Soon he was carefully swung\n",
      "inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head.\n",
      "With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain\n",
      "advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory\n",
      "arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, \"Aye,\n",
      "aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!--an arm and a leg!--an arm\n",
      "that never can shrink, d'ye see; and a leg that never can run.  Where\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The White Whale,\" said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm\n",

      "been a telescope; \"there I saw him, on the Line, last season.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And he took that arm off, did he?\" asked Ahab, now sliding down from\n",

      "\"Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,\"\n",
      "began the Englishman.  \"I was ignorant of the White Whale at that\n",
      "time.  Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and\n",
      "my boat fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too,\n",
      "that went milling and milling round so, that my boat's crew could\n",
      "only trim dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale.\n",
      "Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great\n",

      "wrinkles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was he, it was he!\" cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye--they were mine--MY irons,\" cried Ahab, exultingly--\"but\n",
      "on!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give me a chance, then,\" said the Englishman, good-humoredly.\n",
      "\"Well, this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs\n",
      "all afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my\n",
      "fast-line!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, I see!--wanted to part it; free the fast-fish--an old trick--I\n",

      "\n",
      "\"How it was exactly,\" continued the one-armed commander, \"I do not\n",
      "know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there\n",
      "somehow; but we didn't know it then; so that when we afterwards\n",
      "pulled on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of\n",
      "the other whale's; that went off to windward, all fluking.  Seeing\n",
      "how matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was--the noblest\n",
      "and biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life--I resolved to capture him,\n",
      "spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in.  And thinking the\n",
      "hap-hazard line would get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to\n",
      "might draw (for I have a devil of a boat's crew for a pull on a\n",
      "whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my first mate's\n",
      "boat--Mr. Mounttop's here (by the way, Captain--Mounttop;\n",
      "Mounttop--the captain);--as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop's\n",
      "boat, which, d'ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and\n",
      "snatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it.\n",
      "But, Lord, look you, sir--hearts and souls alive, man--the next\n",
      "instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat--both eyes out--all befogged\n",
      "and bedeadened with black foam--the whale's tail looming straight up\n",
      "out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple.  No use\n",
      "sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding\n",
      "sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second\n",
      "iron, to toss it overboard--down comes the tail like a Lima tower,\n",
      "cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes\n",
      "first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all\n",
      "chips.  We all struck out.  To escape his terrible flailings, I\n",
      "seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment\n",
      "clung to that like a sucking fish.  But a combing sea dashed me off,\n",
      "and at the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards,\n",
      "went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron\n",
      "towing along near me caught me here\" (clapping his hand just below\n",
      "his shoulder); \"yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to\n",
      "Hell's flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the\n",
      "good God, the barb ript its way along the flesh--clear along the\n",
      "whole length of my arm--came out nigh my wrist, and up I\n",
      "floated;--and that gentleman there will tell you the rest (by the\n",

      "The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all\n",
      "the time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote\n",

      "sober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and\n",
      "patched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention\n",
      "between a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in\n",
      "the other, occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs\n",

      "spite of my best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse\n",
      "and worse; the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon\n",
      "ever saw; more than two feet and several inches long.  I measured it\n",
      "with the lead line.  In short, it grew black; I knew what was\n",
      "threatened, and off it came.  But I had no hand in shipping that\n",
      "ivory arm there; that thing is against all rule\"--pointing at it with\n",
      "the marlingspike--\"that is the captain's work, not mine; he ordered\n",
      "the carpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to the\n",
      "end, to knock some one's brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine\n",
      "once.  He flies into diabolical passions sometimes.  Do ye see this\n",
      "dent, sir\"--removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair, and\n",
      "exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not the\n",
      "slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever having been a\n",
      "wound--\"Well, the captain there will tell you how that came here;\n",
      "he knows.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I don't,\" said the captain, \"but his mother did; he was born\n",

      "another Bunger in the watery world?  Bunger, when you die, you ought\n",

      "Spitzbergen whale fishery.  In the first place, the amount of butter,\n",
      "and Texel and Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing.  I impute it,\n",

      "In length, the Sperm Whale's skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two\n",
      "Feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have\n",
      "been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one\n",
      "fifth in length compared with the living body.  Of this seventy-two\n",
      "feet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some\n",
      "fifty feet of plain back-bone.  Attached to this back-bone, for\n",

      "extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled\n",
      "the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some\n",
      "twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,\n",
      "for the time, but a long, disconnected timber.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ribs were ten on a side.  The first, to begin from the neck, was\n",
      "nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each\n",
      "successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one\n",
      "of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches.  From\n",
      "that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last\n",
      "only spanned five feet and some inches.  In general thickness, they\n",
      "all bore a seemly correspondence to their length.  The middle ribs\n",

      "largest of the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that\n",

      "measured but little more than eight feet.  So that this rib only\n",
      "conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that\n",
      "part.  Besides, for some way, where I now saw but a naked spine, all\n",
      "that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh,\n",
      "muscle, blood, and bowels.  Still more, for the ample fins, I here\n",

      "his dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood.  No.\n",
      "Only in the heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings\n",

      "There are forty and odd vertebrae in all, which in the skeleton are\n",

      "For, not to hint of this: that it is an inference from certain\n",

      "no children born to them for the other world, but, on the contrary,\n",
      "shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of all hell's despair;\n",

      "been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or\n",
      "uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal\n",

      "along with one of the paddles of his boat.  All by his own request,\n",
      "also, biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of\n",
      "fresh water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth\n",
      "scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being\n",

      "breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he\n",

      "But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now\n",
      "that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied;\n",
      "soon there seemed no need of the carpenter's box: and thereupon,\n",
      "when some expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said,\n",
      "that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this;--at a critical\n",
      "moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was\n",
      "leaving undone; and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he\n",
      "could not die yet, he averred.  They asked him, then, whether to live\n",
      "or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure.  He\n",
      "answered, certainly.  In a word, it was Queequeg's conceit, that if a\n",
      "man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him:\n",
      "nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable,\n",

      "it necessary.  Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the\n",

      "these circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in\n",
      "strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it.\n",
      "Because in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose various\n",

      "be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea.  So Ahab's\n",
      "proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange thing\n",
      "about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who\n",
      "had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree\n",
      "approaching to decision--one of those too, whose faithfulness on the\n",
      "look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;--it was strange, that this\n",

      "latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his\n",
      "head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings.  Then it darted a\n",
      "thousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards,\n",
      "and went eddying again round his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed\n",

      "That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man--as his wont at\n",

      "went to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely,\n",
      "snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship's dog will, in drawing\n",
      "nigh to some barbarous isle.  He declared that a whale must be near.\n",
      "Soon that peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by\n",
      "the living sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any\n",
      "mariner surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the\n",

      "nearly as possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship's course to be\n",
      "slightly altered, and the sail to be shortened.\n",
      "\n",
      "The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently\n",
      "vindicated at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea\n",
      "directly and lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the\n",

      "were hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way\n",
      "aloft, and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between\n",
      "the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in\n",

      "snow-hill!  It is Moby Dick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three\n",

      "whale they had so long been pursuing.  Ahab had now gained his final\n",
      "perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just\n",
      "beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian's\n",
      "head was almost on a level with Ahab's heel.  From this height the\n",
      "whale was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea\n",
      "revealing his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent\n",
      "spout into the air.  To the credulous mariners it seemed the same\n",
      "silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and\n",
      "Indian Oceans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And did none of ye see it before?\" cried Ahab, hailing the perched\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and\n",

      "reserved the doubloon for me.  I only; none of ye could have raised\n",
      "the White Whale first.  There she blows!--there she blows!--there\n",
      "she blows!  There again!--there again!\" he cried, in long-drawn,\n",
      "lingering, methodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the\n",
      "whale's visible jets.  \"He's going to sound!  In stunsails!  Down\n",
      "top-gallant-sails!  Stand by three boats.  Mr. Starbuck, remember,\n",
      "stay on board, and keep the ship.  Helm there!  Luff, luff a point!\n",
      "So; steady, man, steady!  There go flukes!  No, no; only black water!\n",
      "All ready the boats there?  Stand by, stand by!  Lower me, Mr.\n",
      "Starbuck; lower, lower,--quick, quicker!\" and he slid through the air\n",
      "to the deck.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is heading straight to leeward, sir,\" cried Stubb, \"right away\n",

      "\n",
      "Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; all the boat-sails\n",
      "set--all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to\n",
      "leeward; and Ahab heading the onset.  A pale, death-glimmer lit up\n",
      "Fedallah's sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the\n",
      "sea; but only slowly they neared the foe.  As they neared him, the\n",
      "ocean grew still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves;\n",
      "seemed a noon-meadow, so serenely it spread.  At length the\n",
      "breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his\n",
      "entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as\n",
      "if an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of\n",
      "finest, fleecy, greenish foam.  He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of\n",
      "the slightly projecting head beyond.  Before it, far out on the soft\n",
      "Turkish-rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his\n",
      "broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the\n",
      "shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into\n",
      "the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright\n",
      "bubbles arose and danced by his side.  But these were broken again by\n",
      "the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea,\n",
      "alternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff\n",
      "rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered\n",
      "pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale's back; and at\n",
      "intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and\n",
      "fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked\n",
      "on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.\n",
      "\n",
      "A gentle joyousness--a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness,\n",
      "invested the gliding whale.  Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away\n",
      "with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely,\n",
      "leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching\n",
      "fleetness, rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not\n",
      "Jove, not that great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White\n",
      "Whale as he so divinely swam.\n",
      "\n",
      "On each soft side--coincident with the parted swell, that but once\n",
      "leaving him, then flowed so wide away--on each bright side, the whale\n",
      "shed off enticings.  No wonder there had been some among the hunters\n",
      "who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had\n",
      "ventured to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the\n",
      "vesture of tornadoes.  Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou\n",
      "glidest on, to all who for the first time eye thee, no matter how\n",
      "many in that same way thou may'st have bejuggled and destroyed\n",
      "before.\n",
      "\n",
      "And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea,\n",
      "among waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture,\n",
      "Moby Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of\n",
      "his submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his\n",
      "jaw.  But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for\n",
      "an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like\n",
      "Virginia's Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes\n",
      "in the air, the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of\n",
      "sight.  Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white\n",
      "sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.\n",
      "\n",
      "With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,\n",
      "the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick's\n",
      "reappearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An hour,\" said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat's stern; and he\n",
      "gazed beyond the whale's place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide\n",
      "wooing vacancies to leeward.  It was only an instant; for again his\n",
      "eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle.\n",
      "The breeze now freshened; the sea began to swell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The birds!--the birds!\" cried Tashtego.\n",
      "\n",
      "In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were\n",
      "now all flying towards Ahab's boat; and when within a few yards began\n",
      "fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with\n",
      "joyous, expectant cries.  Their vision was keener than man's; Ahab\n",
      "could discover no sign in the sea.  But suddenly as he peered down\n",
      "and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no\n",
      "bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and\n",
      "magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly\n",
      "revealed two long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating\n",
      "up from the undiscoverable bottom.  It was Moby Dick's open mouth and\n",
      "scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the\n",
      "blue of the sea.  The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like\n",
      "an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his\n",
      "steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous\n",
      "apparition.  Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with him,\n",
      "went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his\n",
      "crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,\n",
      "its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale's head while yet\n",
      "under water.  But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with\n",
      "that malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted\n",
      "himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head\n",
      "lengthwise beneath the boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled\n",
      "for an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner\n",
      "of a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within\n",
      "his mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high\n",
      "up into the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock.  The\n",
      "bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of\n",
      "Ahab's head, and reached higher than that.  In this attitude the\n",
      "White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her\n",
      "mouse.  With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms;\n",
      "but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to\n",
      "gain the uttermost stern.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as\n",
      "the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and\n",
      "from his body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be\n",
      "darted at from the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as\n",
      "it were; and while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a\n",
      "quick crisis impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac\n",
      "Ahab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed\n",
      "him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with\n",
      "all this, he seized the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly\n",
      "strove to wrench it from its gripe.  As now he thus vainly strove,\n",
      "the jaw slipped from him; the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and\n",
      "snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further aft,\n",
      "bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast again\n",
      "in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks.  These floated\n",
      "aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck clinging\n",
      "to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them\n",
      "across.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the\n",
      "first to perceive the whale's intent, by the crafty upraising of his\n",
      "head, a movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment\n",
      "his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite.\n",
      "But only slipping further into the whale's mouth, and tilting over\n",
      "sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw;\n",
      "spilled him out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell\n",
      "flat-faced upon the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little\n",
      "distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in\n",
      "the billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled\n",
      "body; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose--some twenty or\n",
      "more feet out of the water--the now rising swells, with all their\n",
      "confluent waves, dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing\n",
      "their shivered spray still higher into the air.*  So, in a gale, the\n",
      "but half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of the\n",
      "Eddystone, triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale.  It receives its\n",
      "designation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary\n",
      "up-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called\n",
      "pitchpoling, previously described.  By this motion the whale must\n",
      "best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly\n",
      "round and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his\n",
      "vengeful wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more\n",
      "deadly assault.  The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden\n",
      "him, as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus's\n",
      "elephants in the book of Maccabees.  Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in\n",
      "the foam of the whale's insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to\n",
      "swim,--though he could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a\n",
      "whirlpool as that; helpless Ahab's head was seen, like a tossed\n",
      "bubble which the least chance shock might burst.  From the boat's\n",
      "fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him; the\n",
      "clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not succor him; more\n",
      "than enough was it for them to look to themselves.  For so\n",
      "revolvingly appalling was the White Whale's aspect, and so\n",
      "planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he\n",
      "seemed horizontally swooping upon them.  And though the other boats,\n",
      "unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the\n",
      "eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant\n",
      "destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that\n",
      "case could they themselves hope to escape.  With straining eyes,\n",
      "then, they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose\n",
      "centre had now become the old man's head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the\n",
      "ship's mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon\n",
      "the scene; and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed\n",
      "her!--\"Sail on the\"--but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him\n",
      "from Moby Dick, and whelmed him for the time.  But struggling out of\n",
      "it again, and chancing to rise on a towering crest, he\n",
      "shouted,--\"Sail on the whale!--Drive him off!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pequod's prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,\n",
      "she effectually parted the white whale from his victim.  As he\n",
      "sullenly swam off, the boats flew to the rescue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dragged into Stubb's boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white\n",
      "brine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab's bodily\n",
      "strength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body's doom: for\n",
      "a time, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb's boat, like one\n",
      "trodden under foot of herds of elephants.  Far inland, nameless wails\n",
      "came from him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the\n",
      "more abbreviate it.  In an instant's compass, great hearts sometimes\n",
      "condense to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains\n",
      "kindly diffused through feebler men's whole lives.  And so, such\n",
      "hearts, though summary in each one suffering; still, if the gods\n",
      "decree it, in their life-time aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly\n",
      "made up of instantaneous intensities; for even in their pointless\n",
      "centres, those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of\n",
      "inferior souls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The harpoon,\" said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on\n",
      "one bended arm--\"is it safe?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,\" said Stubb, showing\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lay it before me;--any missing men?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One, two, three, four, five;--there were five oars, sir, and here\n",

      "\n",
      "\"That's good.--Help me, man; I wish to stand.  So, so, I see him!\n",
      "there! there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!--Hands\n",
      "off from me!  The eternal sap runs up in Ahab's bones again!  Set the\n",
      "sail; out oars; the helm!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being\n",
      "picked up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the\n",
      "chase is thus continued with what is called double-banked oars.  It\n",
      "was thus now.  But the added power of the boat did not equal the\n",
      "added power of the whale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his\n",
      "every fin; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed, that if\n",
      "now, under these circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an\n",
      "indefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew\n",
      "endure for so long a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining\n",
      "at the oar; a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief\n",
      "vicissitude.  The ship itself, then, as it sometimes happens, offered\n",
      "the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase.\n",
      "Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and were soon swayed up to\n",
      "their cranes--the two parts of the wrecked boat having been\n",
      "previously secured by her--and then hoisting everything to her side,\n",
      "and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it with\n",
      "stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an albatross; the Pequod\n",
      "bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick.  At the well known,\n",
      "methodic intervals, the whale's glittering spout was regularly\n",
      "announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be reported\n",
      "as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the\n",
      "deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the\n",
      "allotted hour expired, his voice was heard.--\"Whose is the doubloon\n",
      "now?  D'ye see him?\" and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he\n",
      "commanded them to lift him to his perch.  In this way the day wore\n",

      "his utmost velocity from the furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus\n",
      "booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air, and piling up a\n",
      "mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the distance of seven\n",

      "against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,\n",
      "for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and\n",

      "\n",
      "Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like\n",

      "halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped\n",
      "from his perch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lower away,\" he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat--a spare\n",

      "As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the\n",
      "first assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for\n",
      "the three crews.  Ahab's boat was central; and cheering his men, he\n",
      "told them he would take the whale head-and-head,--that is, pull\n",
      "straight up to his forehead,--a not uncommon thing; for when within a\n",
      "certain limit, such a course excludes the coming onset from the\n",
      "whale's sidelong vision.  But ere that close limit was gained, and\n",
      "while yet all three boats were plain as the ship's three masts to his\n",
      "eye; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed, almost in\n",
      "an instant as it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a\n",
      "lashing tail, offered appalling battle on every side; and heedless of\n",
      "the irons darted at him from every boat, seemed only intent on\n",
      "annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made.  But\n",
      "skilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in\n",
      "the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though, at times, but by\n",
      "a plank's breadth; while all the time, Ahab's unearthly slogan tore\n",
      "every other cry but his to shreds.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed\n",
      "and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the\n",
      "three lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of\n",
      "themselves, warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in\n",
      "him; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to\n",
      "rally for a more tremendous charge.  Seizing that opportunity, Ahab\n",

      "Caught and twisted--corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose\n",

      "flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab's boat.\n",
      "Only one thing could be done.  Seizing the boat-knife, he critically\n",
      "reached within--through--and then, without--the rays of steel;\n",
      "dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and\n",
      "then, twice sundering the rope near the chocks--dropped the\n",
      "intercepted fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again.\n",
      "That instant, the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining\n",
      "tangles of the other lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the\n",
      "more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes; dashed\n",
      "them together like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach, and\n",
      "then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom,\n",
      "in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced\n",
      "round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of\n",
      "punch.\n",

      "While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out\n",

      "while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial,\n",
      "twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and\n",

      "creamy pool to rescue whom he could;--in that wild simultaneousness\n",
      "of a thousand concreted perils,--Ahab's yet unstricken boat seemed\n",
      "drawn up towards Heaven by invisible wires,--as, arrow-like, shooting\n",
      "perpendicularly from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad\n",
      "forehead against its bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into\n",
      "the air; till it fell again--gunwale downwards--and Ahab and his men\n",
      "struggled out from under it, like seals from a sea-side cave.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first uprising momentum of the whale--modifying its direction as\n",
      "he struck the surface--involuntarily launched him along it, to a\n",
      "little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and\n",
      "with his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his\n",
      "flukes from side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the\n",
      "least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly\n",
      "drew back, and came sideways smiting the sea.  But soon, as if\n",
      "satisfied that his work for that time was done, he pushed his pleated\n",
      "forehead through the ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled\n",
      "lines, continued his leeward way at a traveller's methodic pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again\n",
      "came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the\n",
      "floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,\n",
      "and safely landed them on her decks.  Some sprained shoulders,\n",
      "wrists, and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;\n",
      "inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all\n",
      "these were there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have\n",
      "befallen any one.  As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now\n",

      "comparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous\n",
      "day's mishap.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him;\n",

      "lengthwise, but obliquely from the sea.  Shrouded in a thin drooping\n",
      "veil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then\n",
      "fell swamping back into the deep.  Crushed thirty feet upwards, the\n",
      "waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly\n",

      "once more flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from\n",

      "round and round to the fish's back; pinioned in the turns upon turns\n",
      "in which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions\n",
      "of the lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen;\n",

      "now again steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the\n",

      "b'water.  That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the'\n",
      "b'line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up'\n",
      "b'to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line,'\n",
      "b'which had taken several turns around his chest and neck.'\n",
      "b''\n",
      "b'Tashtego stood in the bows.  He was full of the fire of the hunt.  He'\n",

      "b'he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,'\n",
      "b'exclaimed interrogatively, \"Cut?\"  Meantime Pip\\'s blue, choked face'\n",
      "b\"plainly looked, Do, for God's sake!  All passed in a flash.  In less\"\n",

      "b'So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed'\n",

      "b'business-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially;'\n",
      "b'and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome advice.  The'\n",

      "b'STICK TO THE BOAT, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will'\n",

      "b'this time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale'\n",
      "b'started to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried'\n",
      "b\"traveller's trunk.  Alas!  Stubb was but too true to his word.  It\"\n",
      "b'was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and'\n",
      "b'cool, and flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like'\n",

      "b'miserably.  By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;'\n",
      "b'but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot;'\n",
      "b'such, at least, they said he was.  The sea had jeeringly kept his'\n",
      "b'finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul.  Not drowned'\n",
